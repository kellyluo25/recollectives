## how can a person know everything at eighteen and nothing at twenty-two

*i wrote one last thing as i leave twenty-two behind.* 



 burnt-out ingenues get burned if they continue to flirt with self-delusion.



I turned twenty-three and. 

The elegy would some something like "relentless self-possession." 



There's this lyric in the song that Phoebe sings—"and I wake up in the middle of the night / it's like I can feel time moving"—and it explains this sudden vertigo I've always tried to place, but have been too disoriented to describe. 



I keep thinking about College; not because I'm irrevocably different, but because there's this institution that collapses your self-growth in the four years between eighteen and twenty-two into a permanent fixture.

And maybe it's because I've spent the last 2 years since graduated processing, because I've never gotten the closure, and keep ruminating my way through it. 



I think I made a lot of assumptions about myself, because I knew myself so thoroughly, and the full contours of my wants and needs. 



I've lost a lot of friends before the age of eighteen. Much like a non-Newtonian fluid clutched in the palm of your hand: if you hold tight, it's rock solid; if you let go, even just a little, it melts through your fingers. And you keep grasping, scooping handful after handful—always worried when something will give, but if you clutched any harder, you'd suffocate. So you wonder why you even bother holding on, when everything will go slack and slip through eventually.



Symbolism is another song: mirrorball. How I was just reflecting all the qualities of myself I had found acceptable, or acceptable enough.

That calcifies. Turns into something much uglier.



After some time, after this year, I'll still be here at twenty-three—right where you left me.
