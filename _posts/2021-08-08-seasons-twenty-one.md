In a past-life, I would write series about the seasons. I'd use those installments to mark the passage of time and wax poetic about the seasons evolving and bleeding into each other. That as one season ended and another began, we'd keep moving forward: because the seasons would keep changing even if we asked (kindly) for it to stop. Each new season beautifully distinct from the last, but resolute in their transient familiarity.  

As the twentieth year of the millennia turned into the twenty-first, the days turned into months and the months have become a year and some change. Just like the rest of us, the seasons are scathing, bitter, and weary.

### winter

###### H: 35°F; L: 25°F | snow storms

It was a cold winter. A slog. I was working at five p.m. and all the light would suddenly disappear from the sky. It was dark before dusk, and I was deflated. I didn't know it until the first few days of sun peaked through late February, but it came to me like a full-body restoration. Wilted, is the word. To cower in the absence of sun and calciferol.



### spring

###### H: 82°F; L: 36°F | light rain

I felt vacant. Hollowed out by the past year: one whole year. 

I watched *Mare of Easttown*. Listened to *Sour*, repeatedly, teenage angst on a sonic warpath. I found myself eager to write again, but lost that eagerness as soon as we turned the corner on the solstice. I filled this incessant void called time and played video games, revisited the Pokémon pals of my youth. I took up painting with watercolors, studied up on color theory, and revived pigments from baked slumber with single drops of water.



### summer

###### H: 98°F; L: 72°F | high humidity

It was good for a while. I wish it was still as great as I'd hoped at the start. 



### fall

###### — | brisk chill

When fall begins, we renew.
