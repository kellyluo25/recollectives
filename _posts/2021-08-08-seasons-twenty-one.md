In a past-life, I would write series about the seasons. I'd use those installments to mark the passage of time and wax poetic about the seasons evolving and bleeding into each other. That as one season ended and another began, we'd keep moving forward: because the seasons would keep changing even if we asked (kindly) for it to stop. Each new season beautifully distinct from the last, but resolute in their transient familiarity.  

As the twentieth year of the millennia turned into the twenty-first, the days turned into months and the months have become a year and some change. Just like the rest of us, the seasons are scathing, bitter, and weary.

I read something about the seasons this past year that I'll think about forever: "*the seasons no longer mark the passing of time but various failed bargains with nature.*" I've failed so many times.

### winter

###### H: 35°F; L: 25°F | snow storms

It was a cold winter. A slog. I was working at five p.m. and all the light would disappear from the sky. It was dark before dusk, and I was deflated. I didn't know it until the first few days of sun peaked through late February, but it came to me like a full-body restoration. 

Wilted, is the word. To cower in the absence of sun and calciferol.



### spring

###### H: 82°F; L: 36°F | light rain

I felt vacant. Hollowed out by the past year: one whole year. 

There are a few systematic phases to picking up new interests while the world warps in a different direction. I watched *Mare of Easttown* and couldn't recall the last time I felt so enthralled by a show week-to-week. Listened to *Sour*, repeatedly, as go the chronicles of teenage angst on a sonic warpath. I found myself eager to write again, but lost that eagerness as soon as we turned the corner on the solstice. I filled this incessant void called time by playing video games and revisited the Pokémon pals of my youth. I took up painting with watercolors, studied up on color theory, and revived pigments from pan-baked slumber with drops of water.



### summer

###### H: 98°F; L: 72°F | high humidity

It was good for a while. I wish it was still as great as I'd hoped at the start. I watched the *Gossip Girl* reboot and this was one of many things I would end up disappointed by this summer.



### fall

###### H: 70°F; L: 51°F | brisk chill

When fall begins, we renew. The leaves they stayed on their branches this year. I was in a different state. I ate so many bowls of ramen (indoors), with many different people. I listened to *Red (Taylor's Version)* every chance I got, and it was like coming back to something broken and great again. What was once a crumpled piece of paper smoothed out once again.
