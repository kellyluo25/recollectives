- [the many lives of steven yeun](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/magazine/steven-yeun.html)
  - jay caspian kang interviewed steven yeun on the minari press tour, and i'll think about this articulation of the asian american experience forever. 
  - *“Sometimes I wonder if the Asian-American experience is what it’s like when you’re thinking about everyone else, but nobody else is thinking about you,” Yeun said.*

- [britney spears was never in control](https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/tavi-gevinson-britney-spears-was-never-in-control.html)
  - tavi gevinson wrote about britney spears' conservatorship and the powers forced upon young women
  - *At the same time that young women are disadvantaged by age and gender, youth does carry currency, which can be mistaken for power.*

- [no i'm not ready](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/no-im-not-ready)
  - anne helen peterson found the words for the one-year grieving exercise we experienced in march
  - *Grief metastasizes when neglected. I have experienced it in the form of full body-wracking sobs when a song comes on the radio, and in dreams I wake up from with tears streaming down my face.*

- [thomas cromwell is real and strong and my friend](https://griefbacon.substack.com/p/thomas-cromwell-is-real-and-strong)
  - helena fitzgerald called out calendars for what they are: a coping mechanism for chaos
  - *A calendar is a way to invent meaning where there is none and, often, so is a novel, rendering the cluttered events in a human life into a false and singing coherence.*

- [screenshots tell the real stories about who we are](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/magazine/screenshots.html) 
  - kyle chayka described the purest form of love and attention on our phones, the humble screenshot
  - *And if memories are what make us human, then our screenshots tell a story about who we are in the digital age.*

- [bobos in ikea](https://blgtylr.substack.com/p/bobos-in-ikea)
  - brandon taylor indicted the examined, zillenial life of posturing for the same few statement pieces
  -  *A life that is cosmopolitan, which is to say, a life that belongs to no particular space or time, a life that knows no particular geography. There are no more local lives*

## predictions 2022

###### what's next year without more media & culture

- 1989 (taylor's version) (early summer 2022)
  if taylor can tour, we get 1989 and a blowout summer album to boot. if she can't, we're getting speak now and dear john will shine over many sad empty towns.
- new hozier album, vol.3 (late spring)
  it's about time and we know hozier has been stewing on some sad songs
- persuasion adaptation
  in the year 2020, emma. was so stylistic and sumptuous that they simply have to make another for the most heart-wrenching of the austen novels
- enola holmes sequel
  it's going to be really cotton-candy cute
- never have i ever, s02 (late summer)
  this love triangle is not a triangle, and there really is only one appropriate, definite ending and we are all clear on what that is
- **wildcards**: olivia rodrigo, vol. 2 (fall); harry styles, vol. 3 (late fall/early winter)
