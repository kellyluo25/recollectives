###### dream things for a dream house, year 2023

Making my life materially better.

<!--more--> 


- **my dearest olive**: made my first pilgrimage to olive young; wire baskets overflowing with toners and oils; serums and sunscreens.
- **digital perm**: high-maintenance for low-maintenance. hair that curls and activates with the slight touch of water.
- **miffy coasters**: a resting place for mugs overflowing with near-boiling water, red date healing teas, english breakfast.
- **light linen:** flowy fabric. wrinkles easily, but sways breezily. looks best when the beaches are white sand or when the skies are orange. 
- **hakata ramen**: every bowl savored to the dregs. 
- **7-11 breakfast:** two onigiris, hot hojicha bottle.
- **pink velvet sofa-chaise**: seated in the corner, lie-flat for post-work collapse and lazy evening slumber.
- **itoya spoils:** a twelve-floor stationary store made of dreams, printed on lithographs, gold foil, watercolor inks. 
- **JR rail pass:** three weeks spent on the train, steadily moving from fukuoka through tokyo. archipelago freedom on a teal-green card.
