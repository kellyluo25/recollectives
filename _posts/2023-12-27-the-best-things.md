<ï»¿br />

Making my life materially better.

* **my dearest olive**: made my first pilgrimage to olive young; wire baskets overflowing with toners and oils; serums and sunscreens.
  		- rarely, a few recommendations: healing bird argan oil. round lab birch juice sunscreen. unove deep damage treatment x. labo h scalp-strengthening shampoo. manyo cleaning oil.
* **blushing beauty:** tower 28's cute compacts of saturated color. joeur's rose gold blush on the cheeks.
* **digital perm**: high-maintenance for low-maintenance. hair that curls and activates with the slight touch of water.
* **miffy coasters**: a resting place for mugs overflowing with near-boiling water, red date healing teas, english breakfast.
* **light linen:** flowy fabric. wrinkles easily, but sways breezily. looks best when the beaches are white sand or when the skies are orange. 
* **hakata ramen**: every bowl savored to the dregs. pork bones, stewed whole. salt.
* **7-11 breakfast:** two onigiris, hot hojicha bottle. splurge on a fried chicken nugget.
* **pink velvet sofa-chaise**: seated in the corner, lie-flat for post-work collapse and lazy evening slumber.
* **itoya spoils:** a twelve-floor stationary store made of dreams, printed on lithographs, gold foil, watercolor inks. 
* **JR rail pass:** three weeks spent on the train, steadily moving from fukuoka through tokyo. archipelago freedom on a teal-green card. 
* **stand up**: standing desk from the allbirds office liquidation
* **puzzle pieces:** coming together like pieces fitting into place.
  		- the city by the bay 'the maze puzzle'. magic puzzle company mystic maze. pieceworks type a. ridley's travel destination.
