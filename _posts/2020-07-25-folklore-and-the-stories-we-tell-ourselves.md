when the greeks invented the word for myth, they found a place for all the stories they told and would continue to tell for years to come. when they found mythology, they also found logos. the infinite logic of trying to make sense of our own chaos as a people. 

i've always been fascinated by the personal myths we keep close, woven into the fabric of our own folklore. i'm still working on piecing together the stories i tell myself. the stories we keep repeating even if we know the ending, because maybe this time it will be different. change the lyrics, the setting, the characters. 

i can't recall how many times i've listened to taylor swift's surprise folk-pop album *folklore* since it dropped on midnight, july 24th. who knew the interminable summer of 2020 would coalesce into a surprise autumn from taylor swift? if folklore is a collection of taylor's stories, then it's worth studying why her folklore are the tales that are passed down and whispered around.

### folklore: a review

> speculation, over time, becomes fact. myths, ghost stories and fables. fairytales and parables. gossip and legend.

*folklore* extracts the indie essence of ryan adam's *1989* cover album and taylor metamorphizes her own genre; reminds us these artistic elements have always been there: the melancholic undercurrents of her lyricism, the tight instrumentation that delivers sweeping catharsis.

i heard *folklore* described as a "halcyon album" — her fictionalized songs sprawl time periods and characters borne out of isolated imagination. her collaborators add folksy touches to soft vocals. it's another revolutionary genre shift in her discography, but her emotional storytelling broods and ruminates; then coaxed this sound out of the woods.

this record invites an open contemplation of personal mythology and the stories we tell ourselves and continue to pass down. we will mythologize and tell tales of this era in history for ages to come; and here, taylor swift has woven her own song-stories into the lore. as long as we're still listening.

goodbye ***lover***—sunshine in the meadows of a hot july, iridescent sparkles and boozy frosé popsicles, phoenixes rising and pink-purple sunsets, the way light filters and scatters like a rainbow through a prism, and love like a heartbeat that plucks like a guitar chord.

greetings ***folklore***—vanilla candles flickering in the cottage twilight; rain-soaked grass and long walks in the deep dark forest, that story about little red riding hood and her thoughts, her demons as the big bad wolf, and the quiet of isolation and first chills of the fall. we're not out of the woods yet.
