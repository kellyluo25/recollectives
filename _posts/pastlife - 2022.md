I write this nearly eleven months after my last recapitulation, the life I lived last year. I've walked twice as much this year compared to last year, on roads in different cities, countries even. 

<br />

### a year in review

In 2022, I watched sixteen seasons of television and fifteen films; read approximately fifteen books and listened to at least 53k minutes of music.

## what i read

My reading archive sat somewhat neglected this year (save for a few snowy afternoons in a cabin), but my queue is bountiful as ever. I read a few more contemporary novels and realized a generalized distaste for them. A mislike for matter-of-fact interior monologues that render a stark imitation of the real world on stoic, disconnected terms. I contrast this with the more fanciful writing I found my way back to, and remembering how good it can be. see: [words of worship](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-10/collections-014) (from no. 014, the electric shockwave of finding good writing). I've hardly read anything at all and at the same time I've read so much—upon hundreds of thousands of words—that I find myself daydreaming in ekphrasis.

i went backwards in my reading history, and here are some words i wish i stole and wrote myself. i think of them on occasion, and fondly; they have been folded into me now.

read @ [lighthouse](https://lighthouse.kellyluo.me/) 

- the sequence is at once a terrifying vision and a harrowing memory; never revisited, it forms an invisible spine that connects the series’ two arcs *like ribs, curving out and around without touching*.
- like the great mad women before me, i am spiralling into manic-depressive chaos in a way that i will inevitably romanticize regardless of its material consequences, and self-mythologizing until i can make that feel like a good thing. 
- everything is new which means nothing is new; even the new things already feel used up. everything is so ripe it dissolves in your hands, the juice running down your arm.
- beyond the place where things are named and then stay in the shape of that name. containers do not successfully hold their contents here; we are always spilling over, refusing borders, refusing definitions.
- *fold your paper-thin feelings into mine*, crease the edges, press, and tuck away this raw, numb flatness: shape it into a colorful origami crane and throw it out your bedroom window. shred it. i don’t care. there are no rules.
- our hard human shells carry a soft animal inside: a carnal instinct that is not all wild, that is also loving and a little lonely, desperate for permission to feel.
- i don’t ever talk about it. it’s a bit like a little malformed myth still lodged between my heart and my rib cage.
- fiction is, i think, always kind of about the shock of human experience. the shock of being alive.

## what i wrote

It would not be another year at an end and a new year at the start if I did not lament how little writing I did compared to the quantity of writing I had sought out to do. The inconsistency looms large, as always (so many words I'm trying to get out; I wish they'd pour out of me). 

Here are the things I wrote that I'm most partial to:
[not the marriage plot](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-09/not-the-marriage-plot) (long live the romance of it all); [this is the last time](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-11/this-is-the-last-time) (saying goodbye again) [ripe avocado, runny yolk, french batard](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-11/still-life-avocado-toast) (avocado toast, a still-life), [brainrot](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-11/brainrot) (brain chemistry, altered). *also*: [to @klyluo, with love](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-11/to-klyluo-with-love) (i go back and forth between this being the best / worst thing i've ever written, but i could not separate myself from this year without these words i've written. maybe one day you'll see it again in a bound collection of essays.)

## what i did

I received multiple boarding passes, baked 

seasons. 

<br />

## what i thought

- sloughed-off ambition. as if i'd been paved over, flattened. 
- **prosaic voice:** I read my prose back to myself and notice so much of my writing sounds the same these days. I don't know if this is evidence of style *or* stock. My words are arranged like stereoisomers: of equal constitutions, but reformed in spatial orientation. I looked around and apparently these schemes are canonized as parataxis and hypotaxis and asyndeton. I want to try my hand at experimental forms again and let words roam like outgrowth. I want to surprise myself with structures and syntax; stop weeding the garden beds before they've sprouted. Perhaps even find more great sentences to steal. 
- **letting go, allowing yourself to grow**.
