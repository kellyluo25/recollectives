I write this nearly eleven months after my last recapitulation, the life I lived last year. 

<br />

### a year in review

In 2022, I watched thirty-one seasons of tv and twenty-four films; read approximately twelve bo

## what i read

Rather than rehash how I've failed my Goodreads reading challenge once again, I've sifted through my favorite reads from my Instapaper archive. To know what someone reads is to know how they think; and to know what resonates is to know who they'll become as a result.

## what i wrote

It would not be a year at an end and another year at the start if I did not lament how little writing I did compared to the quantity of writing I'd sought out to do. The inconsistency looms large, as always (so many words I'm trying to get out; I wish they'd pour out of me). 

Here are the things I wrote that I'm rather fond of: 
[not the marriage plot](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-09/not-the-marriage-plot) (long live the romance of it all); [words of worship](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-10/collections-014) (from no. 014, the electric shockwave of finding good writing), [ripe avocado, runny yolk, french batard](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-11/still-life-avocado-toast) (avocado toast, a still-life), [brainrot](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-11/brainrot) (brain chemistry, altered)

from @klyluo, with love (i go back and forth between this being the best / worst thing i've ever written, but i could not separate myself from this year without these words i've written. maybe one day you'll see it again in a bound collection of essays.)

## what i did

I received multiple boarding passes, baked bread

## what i resolve

- sloughed-off ambition. as if i'd been paved over, flattened.

### and onwards to the next

Somehow I think writing this over a span of two months and a long afternoon was an unconsciously proactive attempt at evading nostalgia before it strikes; and writing this year in review was certainly less tumultuous than writing the one from the year before last. But I sense there's an unrealized mechanism of self-preservation at play here: if I don't make the conscious effort to concretize the hills and valleys of the last year, the sandstorm will blow through and flatten my memory into soft blurs of a pandemic purgatory. Maybe this will be how I prove to my future self that the current of change carried me through even as time stood still. It's so easy to forget so much, and these annualized diaristic tendencies keep the topography alive and wild. Over the next year, I'll capture everything else: what I thought, acquired, valued, and foresaw.
