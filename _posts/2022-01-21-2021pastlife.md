Last year ruthlessly settled into this year—2022 rolled in and receded a bit, and I finally found a Sunday afternoon to ruminate on the year we just left behind. More than anything, 2021 left us: a once hopeful reprieve that spiraled and thrashed in a final disappearing act. In that year-long unease, *this* is what I read, wrote, did, and resolve to do more of.



### a year in review

In 2021, I watched thirty-one seasons of tv and twenty-four films; read approximately twelve books; and mindlessly tabulated myself in other ways: like first adult apartment, seven spice bottles and fourteen bottles of sauce, and six strands of christmas lights.

## what i read

Rather than rehash how I've failed my Goodreads reading challenge once again, I've sifted through my favorite reads from my Instapaper archive. To know what someone reads is to know how they think; and to know what resonates is to know who they'll become as a result.

## what i wrote

I wrote without any desirable consistency *here*, but I wrote a few things elsewhere that I'm quite fond of: [and i was thinking on the drive down](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2021-12/on-the-plane-over) (thoughts about the places we go); [knowing all the words to your old favorite song](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2021-11/musical-memorabilia) (music and memory, and the passing of time in-between); [fighting fire with fire](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2021-04/collections-006) (from no. 006, the little fires everywhere in our pandemic year); and [seasons mmxxi](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2021-12/seasons-twenty-one) (how i actually felt about the course of this past year).



## what i did

The true highlights of the past year are documented through digital photos or sharp anecdotes: there's a lot I did (and didn't do)—in life, at home, or for work. This, however, is a shrine to all the little things I did for myself that still *matter*, but didn't make it to the front page.

I acquired a boarding pass for my first flight in two years (seat 15C), found a gift card that had been missing since late 2018, and filed my taxes through the grit of self-determination and free tax software. I assembled furniture with my bare hands and a tiny allen wrench, bought smart color-changing light bulbs as anyone with agency over their room lighting should do, and spent ridiculous sums of money on storage bins to contain the sprawl of my transposed and newly-acquired possessions. I also started writing ***collections*** and valiantly continue my attempts to collect myself to write more, set-up my Instapaper and e-mail newsletter-sorting system that feels like the better part of my brain if I actually took the quiet time to read everything I saved-for-later, and collaged my reading highlights into word-panes of the [***lighthouse***](https://lighthouse.kellyluo.me/). I even caught up on *Succession* and *Sex Education* (arriving about three-years late to the cultural phenomenon), finally understood why people buy cookbooks (no, a nine-minute YouTube video is not a suitable equivalent), and found a faintly-floral fragrance I'm quite satisfied with (apparently maturation is finding appreciation for former derision).



## what i resolve

It would be unkind to make resolutions for the new year, as I've unsuccessfully done for so many years in the past. I do, however, have a few themes I'm resolved to continue exploring in the third year of this new decade:

**unlock what makes me tick**: taking notice of the small things where I'll go the extra mile, that uplift and delight in opposition to mundanity, and unabashedly wielding these weapons of self-indulgence; things like clever turns of phrase and alliteration, or well-considered artifacts (format and presentation, itself, as a craft), or cultivating an abundance of supply rather than cowering against scarcity. finding the absolute greatest joy in being extra because doing any less would be deflating.

**attend the academy of real-life**: "adult enrichment" is one of the funniest phrases there ever was, advertised as if being an adult were thoroughly devoid of enriching activities and the buck stopped when we last pursued resume-padding extracurriculars in high school; there's something entirely ridiculous in the notion that learning stopped after that last diploma and tuition debt. there also is, perhaps, an endless queue of subjects I've signed myself up to learn under the pretense of inching closer to mastery—such as writing creatively about reality, dissecting and then weaponizing comedy, growing at my job discipline, even working clay on a kiln, and if a future impulse purchase comes to be, melting wax into candles or a driving class for good measure—alongside everything else I'm supposed to learn about living with a newfound modicum of financial independence. doing everything also means doing nothing; life is long and hobbies are a dime a dozen ("so what do you do for fun?"). there are a lot of things I want to do and conquer in the new school of life, and my starting point needs to be simply showing up for class.

**making do with what's here**: maybe, just maybe, there's less novelty in racing toward the finish line when the time horizon has moved back by a few dozen decades. this means I've been slowly attempting to remind myself into reinforcement: the gift of discontent is to have *something* to start*,* and the courageous disposition to want better for yourself. so stop doing whatever you think will sound good when you say it out loud, and focus on what feels good if you just stopped to do it.

<br />

### and onwards to the next

Somehow I think writing this over a span of two months and a long afternoon was an unconsciously proactive attempt at evading nostalgia before it strikes; and writing this year in review was certainly less tumultuous than writing the one from the year before last. But I sense there's an unrealized mechanism of self-preservation at play here: if I don't make the conscious effort to concretize the hills and valleys of the last year, the sandstorm will blow through and flatten my memory into soft blurs of a pandemic purgatory. Maybe this will be how I prove to my future self that the current of change carried me through even as time stood still. It's so easy to forget so much, and these annualized diaristic tendencies keep the topography alive and wild. Over the next year, I'll capture everything else: what I thought, acquired, valued, and foresaw.
