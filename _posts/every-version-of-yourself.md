**it's 2am and i'm listening to mirrorball**



*i'll show you every version of yourself tonight*



a poorly kept secret is that i adore the first half of *folklore* (the second half, i regularly ignore)



steven yeun used the phrase "prismatic neurosis" and I haven't been able to shake it. prismatic; as in multivariate and multidimensional, as in filtering and scattering light; as in showing you something different each time you look at it. 



and the mirroball itself is a prism: draws light, and reflects it in every direction.
