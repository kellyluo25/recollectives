i love winter. i love the way the frost clings to surfaces with an unyielding attachment, the way the cold works its way into your bones and won’t let out. winter is bitter and unrelenting, and it has a sinister and unsuspecting way of creeping up on you. a biting chill that rattled your insides and stayed past its welcome.
