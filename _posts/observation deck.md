I've been thinking recently about the cinematographic hallmarks of the male vs. female gaze in media. Namely, if there are any giveaways that clue in female involvement in the act of creation; and in contrast, when a non-male perspective is obviously absent. In particular, I've been mulling on the representation of asymmetrical power. When the power imbalance is starkly evident. I'm inclined to claim a male-revisionist interpretation of giving a female power in this situation is giving her a bombastic presence, the kind that spits in your face and says harsh words. It's a verbal claim to power, because the masculine understanding of it is wielded in the tangibles. This is short of thrusting a sword and shield in her hands for combat. But I think a more feminine touch understands the quietness of it. The fast-burn resistance and resentment, the constant calculation.

There's a scene early in the first season of *The Crown,* where King George is sat next to Phillip on the dock. They've gone out bird hunting, as men do. The king implores (rather, insists) that Phillip's greatest duty is to "Love her. Protect her. She is the job." Elizabeth is duty.
