###### i set a timer for thirty minutes and wrote a vignette.
somewhat related, but i've been thinking recently about the cinematographic hallmarks of the male vs. female gaze in media. namely, if there are any giveaways that clue in female involvement in the act of creation; and in contrast, when a non-male perspective is obviously absent. in particular, i've been mulling on the representation of asymmetrical power. when the power imbalance is starkly evident. i'm inclined to claim a male-revisionist interpretation of giving a female power in this situation is giving her a bombastic presence, the kind that spits in your face and says harsh words. it's a verbal claim to power, because the masculine understanding of it is wielded in the tangibles. this is short of thrusting a sword and shield in her hands for combat. but i think a more feminine touch understands the quietness of it. the fast-burn resistance and resentment, the constant calculation.

There's a scene early in the first season of *The Crown,* where King George is sat next to Phillip on the dock. They've gone out bird hunting, as men do. The king implores (rather, insists) that Phillip's greatest duty is to "Love her. Protect her. She is the job." Elizabeth is duty.

his fingers are tucked beneath her chin, pivoting her head side to side. a ball in a socket, twisting about. the skin on her face is thick, metaphorically, but thin, literally. he imagines she slathers on la mer every night before sleeping, cakes her cheeks beneath botanical emulsions so they'll never see a dry morning. there's a faint dusting of blush on her upper cheeks, smeared down to a mere suggestion in haste. the angry swipe of middle and ring finger against a pan of cherry red. one of her eyebrows almost jumps up in a quizzical glance. but she's trained well, and she quickly schools her composure to position zero. 

"right," he says. takes a step back; keeps his grip on her chin.

"so, what do you think?" she asks. she's standing on her tip-toes. still, her head held high. 

"fine, it's all fine."

she rolls her eyes. the first sign of reputed insolence. "i'm not here to be lied to."

she raises the back of her right hand and smears it against her mouth. peels back a smudge of high-shine gloss and scarlet; the impression of a murky red river mapped out on her skin. she tucks in aberrant streaks at the edges of her lips. something whole again. something less practiced, more convivial. 

instantly, she knows it's better. her eyes don't seek anything but acceptance; never approval.

"as i said, fine."
