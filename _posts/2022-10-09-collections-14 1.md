## screaming crying throwing up
###### you had to have been there
This is one of those things where you had to have been there to know what it really means. If you were a preteen girl once, you get pretty close


  

## hello girl
###### clean girl, material girl, *that* girl 





## this past month

- **watched**: *the summer i turned pretty*
- **not watching:** the fleabag-ification of [persuasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz7HmgPJQak). 
- **read**: *book lovers* by emily henry
	- such a smart book. knows the tropes of a small town romance and plays those cards so well. 
- **listening**: *the summer i turned pretty* soundtrack could hardly be more perfect if it triedâ€”taylor, bleachers, olivia, phoebe, carly. *and* bon iver. plus billie and ariana just for kicks.
