#### **plane, exit row**

Planes are the perfect place to meet people if you never want to see them again. Not before security: that's where you go to say goodbye. Or near baggage claim, where you go to say hello again. 

When you're on a plane, this hunk of industrialized society high in the sky, All your laugh lines were in the same place as before. There was that thing you did, where you'd always talk in the past tense. This memory and that anecdoteâ€”you were full of them, 





#### **bus, boston-bound**







#### holiday market, union square

You were very, very high on the list of people I never thought I would see again. This is the dangerous thing about being in New York. People frequent the same places, walk the same roads; small town, big city.

I felt thrown into another timeline. 





#### subway platform, R 

The thing that scared me was how normal it all sounded. Years of enmity can collapse if you discuss the same things you always did, as if no time had elapsed at all. Every around us still talk, but we don't.





#### elevator, seventh floor





#### entryway, exit

I was crying. 



#### bar, brattle st.

and it taught me how little they knew about me, in reality. How they didn't pay attention; or how I didn't let them in to know enough.
