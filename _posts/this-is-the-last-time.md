###### this is the last time i ever saw you

people i haven't seen or thought about in ages, but then time catches up and we always write about the first times and introductory meetings; we never know when the goodbye is coming.                                   



#### **plane, exit row**

Planes are the perfect place to meet people if you never want to see them again. Not before security: that's where you go to say goodbye. Or near baggage claim, where you go to say hello again. 

When you're on a plane, this hunk of industrialized society suspended in the stratosphere, you expect to fully disconnect from all the humanity that awaits you below. You don't expect to find yourself sitting next to an old friend, who had long since left the premises—and is doing just fine, thanks for asking—but you'd never wondered how they were or what they were up to.

All your laugh lines were in the same place as before. There was that thing you did, where you'd always talk in the past tense. This memory and that anecdote—you were full of them, filled the brim of tales that weren't always your own. I think I laughed the entire time. Every pause was a transition to the next beat in the story. 





#### **bus, boston-bound**

It was really nice to meet you.





#### holiday market, union square

You were very, very high on the list of people I never thought I would see again. This is the dangerous thing about being in New York. People frequent the same places, walk the same roads: small town, big city.

Here's the scene: perusing festive shops at the holiday market, studying the menu at Wafels & Dinges (the stand right at the corner of the park), looking up once—and that partial moment of recognition occurred. You turned to your friends and I turned to my friends, and it was like nothing ever happened. Nobody saw anything. It never happened.

But I felt thrown into another timeline. 





#### subway platform, R 
It was the day after something else. It was barely seven in the morning, the last hours before the crush of rush hour. 
The thing that scared me was how normal it all sounded. Years of enmity can collapse if you discuss the same things you always did, as if no time had elapsed at all. Every around us still talks, but we don't.

We were waiting at the same place we always did. 





#### elevator, seventh floor





#### entryway, exit

I was crying. 




#### bar, brattle st.

We were sitting in a high-top table near the entrance. Everyone we knew was there that night. We were all everywhere, anywhere. At some point, you walked through the front door and past the table. You greeted someone else and then greeted me, then goodbye.

It taught me how little they knew about me, in reality. How they didn't pay attention; or how I didn't let them in to know enough.




#### unknowable (parking lot probably)
I don't remember this one. I'm sorry, I didn't know. I swear—(I swear it; nobody told me. I swear it on soft serve vanilla cones with sprinkles and gummy bears on the side. Pinky promise on the banana-flavored popsicles you always had in the freezer and every time I think of you in the grocery store aisles)—it wasn't until years later when the truth was delivered to me as a correction. I said your name in passing, in present tense. And that was wrong.

You knew me best of anyone, but I didn't know much about you at all; at least, not enough. Do all forms of doting inspire reverence, even in hindsight? I remember everything else, the trailing behind you in small sandaled steps, the getting what I pleaded for, the waiting for you in between absences. I wish I could remember this, but I didn't know it was the last time, even when I never expected a next time.
