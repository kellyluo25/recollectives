### listen up and let me tell you a story

###### the six wives are here to reclaim the musical narrative from henry viii

There is something truly miraculous about the things you learn in high school. Those formative years cram facts and formulas into your growing brain, some of which will never see the light of day again but a lot of which will resurface in entirely unsuspecting ways. The scene is AP European History, sophomore year of high school. 

They turned historemix into a real word, and somewhere out there in the world, Lin Manuel Miranda is picking up another biography at the airport.







## this new year

- **watched**: euphoria (season 02)
- **read**: 
- **listened**: del water gap, jeremy zucker (a misplaced sad indie boy revival)
