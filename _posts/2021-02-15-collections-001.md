###### collections: a weekly reset



It's February 15th. We're one-and-a-half months into the new year. 

- **all stories have a beginning, middle, and end**: to all the boys: always and forever ends as a love letter to endings and how hard it is to say goodbye.
- **we were both young**: love story (taylor's version) collapsed the years between middle school and adulthood.

### all stories have a beginning, middle, and end

###### to all the boys: always and forever ends as a love letter to endings and how hard it is to say goodbye.

I don't think I fully understood myself as a person, as a young woman shedding the relics of her teenage girlhood, until I realized *why* I love *to all the boys* so much. It's something that transcends a lifelong appreciation for romcoms and aesthetic staples of the tried and true teen experience. It is deeply personal in a way I have spent so long trying to articulate. I am working on a draft of it, borne from the genetics of a movie review and personal essay.

I have watched the final *to all the boys* installment a few times since it was released this past weekend and it leaves my half-empty rather than half-full. I had waited so long for this final film and it was finally here. As soon as it was here, it was over. There will be no more *to all the boys.*

I was struck by the sudden dread and fascination by the timeline: that I have spent the past two and a half years of my life waiting for this adaptation. That I had eager, but relatively low expectations when the first film came out as an adaptation of this cutesy YA series I had first read as a high school summer; and it had transcended my wildest pastel-pink daydreams for what this series could be. How I had spent the summer of 2018 re-reading the trilogy during my internship commute, and I found myself sympathizing with our teenage protagonist when I was decidedly no longer a teenager in her shoes. That span of time since has been spent waiting for this final release in earnest, of the best and most emotionally satisfying part of this series. 

It reminds me how precarious and delicate happiness can feel if it is measured by the yardstick of arbitrary milestones. How we will be inevitably be disappointed and confused when it doesn't go according to plan. It's not like there wasn't a plan, and what good is a plan when it's never put into place?



### we were both young

###### love story (taylor's version) collapses the years between middle school and adulthood.

Taylor Swift is re-recording her old albums. She is reclaiming ownership of her sophomore album, and every other album that is an artifact of her artistic genius, whimsy, and imagination. *Fearless* is Taylor at her most wide-eyed and naÃ¯ve, committed to storybook endings and fairytale romances before she had to grow up. 

> so before i say anything else, let me just say that it was a real honor to get to be a teenager alongside you.

Thirteen years have elapsed, such that *Fearless* is practically a teenager by this point.

Listening to  "Love Story" again through more mature ears doesn't make the song any less lovely and magical than the first time around. This was the song that catapulted Taylor into the stratosphere for the first time, and it was the kind of inescapable song about a forbidden Romeo and Juliet-esque romance that made any middle school girl recount her most fanciful romantic plots.

So much time has passed since the original that it's updated iteration feels tinted through  Taylor's memory and the parallel track of my nostalgia. It's a weird feeling that will only compound when the full *Fearless* album is released in April.
