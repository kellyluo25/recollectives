###### collections: a weekly reset



It's February 21st.

- **romanticizing the forgotten half of the holland tunnel**: jack antonoff & co makes me think about the underdog narrative baked into the jersey suburbs. it's quite literally something i've never thought about until bleachers made music.
- **half-baked, inchoate thoughts**: why do we always preemptively disclaim our personal opinions by saying they're not fully formed? (i do it too)
- **my youtube playlist mixtape**

## this past week

- **watched**: 
- **read**:
- **listened**: [get lucky (cover) by daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5Cp55MvX54)
