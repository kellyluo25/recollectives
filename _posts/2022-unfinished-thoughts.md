###### collections: a weekly reset



On this date.

- **romanticizing the forgotten half of the holland tunnel**: jack antonoff & co makes me think about the underdog narrative baked into the jersey suburbs. it's quite literally something i've never thought about until bleachers made music.
- **half-baked, inchoate thoughts**: why do we always preemptively disclaim our personal opinions by saying they're not fully formed? (i do it too)
- **my youtube playlist mixtape**
- **attic-dwellers that live rent-free**: the things i should start charging rent for in my mind
- **the genius of spotify playlists**
