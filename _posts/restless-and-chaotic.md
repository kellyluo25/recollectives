*House of the Dragon* feels distinct from the disgraced legacy of the original series. I didn't expect this show to succeed, and truly, when the first stills of episode 7 were put forth, I didn't expect anyone else to think it would succeed either.

- [1x01] juxtaposition of battlefields: when aemma says "the childbed is our battlefield" and we juxtapose men inflicting violence upon women's bodies to further patriarchal entitlements against men inflicting violence upon other men for performative sport
- [1x03] my favorite scene of the season is rhaenyra stabbing the jugular out of this hog
- side note: my actual favorite scene of this show is the necklace scene in the throne room in the pilot. it so immediately establishes the dynamic between to key characters, and continues to cascade throughout the season. 
- [1x03] at no point did we miss single-shot battle sequences, but the daemon suicide mission feels like a character *becoming*, cloaked in plot armor
- the rhaenyra and daemon thing is emma and mr. knightley and i will not comment on it any further
- repetition of the valyrian steel necklace 
- [1x04] juxtaposition of pleasure: the daemon and rhaenyra in the brothel mashed up with alicent and king viserys is something else. 
- [1x04] impossible to not have thoughts about episode 4, but the provocation is in part, due to the blessing of its female directorship. that's indubitably my favorite part about it. 
- desperately need this show to continue to be written by women, where the women are allowed to be morally grey and the men are allowed to be awful, but the awfulness of men should not come at the expense of the women
- shorter hair daemon targaryen
- [1x05] *are you asking for leave?* when i say i laughed out loud
- someone called the sixth episode a second pilot
- loneliness: they're all so lonely when we visit them again
- [1x06] that one-take shot of postpartum rhaenyra in the castle, and the parallel to our introduction to an older rhaenyra giving birth to a healthy third son, both as a duty spurned by a younger rhaenyra and parallel to her mother's long labors
- [1x06] leana's death by dragon, going out as a dragonrider; the second childbirth death in the twin pilots but this one is granted the courage of agency 
- the physical acting is so good, especially the nervous tics that carry through the years
- [1x07] valyrian wedding ceremonies don't shy away from the *blood* part of fire and blood
- [1x07] this sad shot of daemon on the beach, listening to the far cries of vhagar; a dragon he knows almost as intimately as his own. a dragon that belonged to his late wife of ten years, and before that, his father. this dragon is as much a part of him and his family, as it is claimed by his mirror image on the greens.
- this daemon / aemond parallel is out of hand
- desperately need this show to continue to be written by women, where the women are allowed to be morally grey and the men are allowed to be awful, but the awfulness of men should not come at the expense of the women
