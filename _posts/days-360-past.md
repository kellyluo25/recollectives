###### antemeridian; and the last good day



i didn't want to write about how it's been 360 days since i was sent home packing, so i wrote about what i remember from the last good day.



---





I can't stop writing about this day. I've written about it before (here, here, and in pages of a journal). That day means something different to each of us. It's an obsession, and a compulsion to relive the details. 

I'm writing this all down now because I know one day I'll forget it. I'm forgetting it now.

Another email. My midterm was postponed, but the professor was still. 

I didn't go. I didn't care enough. 





The very last thing anybody needs is a recreation of pre-pandemic life or a melodramatic homage to the *before*-time. It will never be enough, because no matter what I do or how hard I work or where I go or how many shooting stars I wish upon, this will be time I will never get back.

It was a Tuesday. 

Time tells all, and the records on my iPhone's sleep tracker say I went to bed at 1:45 a.m. and woke up at 8:15 a.m. that same morning. I woke up early in the a.m. and went through the usual motions of my morning routine. My feet traced the same everyday steps between my room to the suite bathroom and back to my room.

The first email came at 8 a.m. Somewhere between the layers of moisturizer and sunscreen, I picked up my phone and read it without understanding what I was reading. It sounded like plans were canceled and I had to go home. Something like that. 



I did my morning routine: grabbed my tea and then ran to the shuttle.





I opted to walk; one of the last walks I would ever take through campus. 



I don't remember what I ate for lunch that day. I think I grabbed a bagged meal that morning to ensure I wouldn't have to return to the dining hall for lunch: it was a calculated decision to minimize wasted commute time and maximize valuable study time. If I had to take an educated guess, it was probably like all of my other bagged lunches that year: a caprese spinach wrap with chobani vanilla yogurt and baby carrots. 

It's those little details that I still cling to, the parts of the timeline where the memory is still alive and I can almost recreate the routines of a past-life.



Some of my friends were taking their thesis photos.



I had a quiz in an hour and I needed to study; because somehow, in this alternate version of the universe I had found myself in today, a quiz on the mechanics of x-ray imaging and computed tomography still felt really important. There I was, sitting in the middle of one of my favorite cafes on campus (they were always stocked with coconut water, naked smoothies, and the sweet mint orbit gum I chewed religiously).

There were parties, somewhere in the distance.

I had a half-written thesis draft, but I didn't want to leave before I got my due; and if there was anything to show for the weeks and weeks I had spent in lab, it would be a single photo of me on the steps of a historic library bulit in the name of another human tragedy.



because if I pick at one of the loose threads, the entire tapestry will unravel. A chaotic mess of storylines



All the tables in the dining hall had been pushed together. I was eating a plate of chicken, my plate squished against someone else's tray. My memory may fail me, but I think egg noodles were also part of the night's meal. They had run out of provisions with the looming shut-down.  



I called my parents. Everybody was calling their parents. I think some people were crying on that phone. Maybe I made that up in my imagination. Maybe it was me



that everyone had sounded so cavalier about would upend life as we knew it. I spent nearly all of it at home. For that, I am so grateful. 



I spent my preteen years reading YA dystopian romance novels. The kind where it was one teenage girl against the world, and she had to put the two-faced, power hungry adults in their place, and also figure out everything and everyone who was essential to her continued survival.

This is not a dystopia. Perhaps some elements of the apocalypse have made its way into our modern-day narrative, but



How everything is normal before it feels abnormal. How I can barely recall what happened the first few years, but I can recall everything that happened in those last three-days with stunning clarity.



I had a midterm and a quiz that day.



(like this incredible coverage by Ed Yong at *The Atlantic*, and I could only get halfway through his cover story before I felt like I was drowning.)



Everything I was thinking about in the *before* time: 

- I was behind on my thesis experiments. I needed the data to complete a pivotal part of analysis, and I was stressed because it required at least another twenty hours of lab work I had to squeeze out while writing my final manuscript. I spent so much time thinking and working on it; all that time, wasted.
- We were out of soap and needed to buy some. Vigorous hand-washing was the key to mitigating risk. The last weekend, I had taken a break from writing my thesis in the corner of the dining hall to buy a 64 fl oz bottle of Target-brand soap. It felt essential and non-negotiable at the time. When I packed up my things and left, the soap was forgotten underneath the sink.
- Planning for our spring break trip had ceased due to disorganization and disinterest. I was sad about it. I didn't quite know why at the time, but I think I know now. It was never meant to be.



Don't ask me if I'm still sad about itâ€”because I don't want to be, but I probably still am. I'll probably always be sad about it. A gaping wound where the scab didn't fully form and never healed properly. Sometimes it will sting, and it will inadvertently return to me when I think I've forgotten. It's one of those things where you don't forget, and then you spend the rest of your days reliving the memories in the time and space around it. Just like this.





*fin*.
