i traded my mother tongue for fluency in assimilation. i would have cut it out myself, muscle from membrane, if it made me sound more like everyone else. 

my ancestors could not recognize me. i am saturated with a culture that does not belong to me, or anyone who looks like me. *repeat after me*, the pundits bade me. familiarity, too, can be outsourced for manufactureâ€”made in elsewhere. my repertoire of practiced references play on loop. they fall easily and cleanly from a foreign mouthpiece.

these are not the old songs or icons my parents grew up with. i have the influences of a ghost generation, postured on borrowed capital. look at my nostalgic farce in the mirror, the wistful gaze of a past from a different continent. i am scrubbed clean of their homeland; found a new home in this western palimpsest. if i looked all the way down the barrel, there is no heritage of mine to claim.
