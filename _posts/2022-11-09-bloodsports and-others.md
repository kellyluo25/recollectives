today is not tuesday poetry; but rather a collection of poems i'll never finish. in the spirit of anti-completionism, i'm excerpting partial-phrases from my notebook at various points in the year. one of the greatest joys and crushing defeats of having an archive of past writing is realizing that so much of it is unfulfilled potential: scraps of beautiful prose that never found a home or a proper resolution. but it's also gratifying to return to words that you wrote down once because they sounded pleasant, and to find a reminder that they're just as lovely with mild age. to see where these could-be stories started and stopped.

***what people do***

when people say they're afraid of the dark, i think they really mean to say they're afraid of themselves of the dark. when the lights are down low and you cannot see your face. you reach out with ten fingers and find the slope of your nose, trace the rise and fall of your cheeks. slow breathing, drumming along the beat. isn't it funny; doesn't it feel the same way in the dark, too?

here is what i think people do after the dark. they drink whiskey sours after last call at the bar. they teer in high heels down empty city streets. they set early alarms and pray that, in the morning, they'll feel better. they read their children bedtime stories from a picture book. they check under the bed for monsters, but all the monsters are already here.

but i cannot see myself in this room,\
only darkness

***chemtrails***

i am so sick of people.\
i am so sick of what they leave behind.\
i can still feel you. it feels like
ghost pressure in your palm when someone lets go,\
base notes of a scent gone missing. 

what people leave behind:\
i see you everywhere, nowhere.\
traces of themselves for you to find.\
scavenger hunt. i have been scavenged.

(promise me you will think of me.\
promise me you won't.)

moreover:\
cold faucet left running.\
expired postage on torn mail.\
sticky, oily fingerprints on wineglasses.\
mauve lipstick on stained napkins.

if i could collect all the pieces of you,\
i could build a full person again

frankenstein's monster,\
i could be, made of you.\
fusing all the remains,\
until there's is little left\
(i am left.\
you left meâ€”you are made of me)

*q:*\
***would you give me your heart if i asked for it?***

*a:*\
my blades are left-handed\
but right hand over my fucking heart,\
i would have cut it out\
for you, myself\
if only you had asked

it would have hurt\
less.

***any(young)body***

they said the old gods bled ichor,\
honey-wine and fine ambrosia,\
but you, child, are no godâ€”\
when you bleed,\
you bleed out.

***salted oranges***
- flaked salt upon citrus, taste of sweet and tart
- the edge of something raw and unrestrained
- coarse grains cracked over soft flesh, bursting open,\
  just after ripe
- tropical winters.\
  like an old, forgotten vacation,\
  sunbeams that broke through the moody clouds
- scared to bite the bitter of the pulp, for\
  someday it might break through
- paying penance,\
  slaked thirst
