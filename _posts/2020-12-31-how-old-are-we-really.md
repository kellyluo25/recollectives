# happy, free, confused, and lonely (in the best way)

###### *on turning **twenty-two** in the year 2020.*



There's a certain rite of passage when you turn twenty-two. All the major young adult milestones are presumably behind you: you've voted in an election, had your first legal drink of alcohol, and graduated from university. Everything ahead of you now exists in the postgraduate limbo called the rest of your life. You also listen to Taylor Swift's "22" because *i don't know about you*, but you wouldn't really be twenty-two without it.

"22" is a song that has turned an unremarkable age into a fanciful destination. Nothing is new anymore, but you'll know the feeling of one of those sleepless nights–those nights you were surrounded by everyone and no one at the same time, where nothing felt like everything and everything you could have ever wanted was in one place, and it could have been a perfect polaroid to recall in your sentimentally senile days . When *Red* debuted in 2012 with the masterpiece that is "22", we were twelve going on thirteen: we had just found our first footholds in our teen years with this beacon of twenty-two to look up to. Some day we would know what it would feel like to dress, look, act carefree and unencumbered in the cosmic glow of our birthday. 

A perfect storm of happy, free, confused, and lonely. 

When we get to that fateful day, the self-referential title serves its fullest purpose. "22" is about turning 22, embracing it, wondering what it's all about. When we play it at the loudest volume our speakers can tolerate and shout the chorus at the top of our lungs, it's the *hoping* and *wanting* and *celebrating* the misery and magic of turning twenty-two in a cursed year.

Take these last three minutes and twenty seven seconds with your hipster glasses and oversized t-shirts. You may never feel this way again, but

When you're a kid, you close your eyes and blow out your candles to count down the days until you become an adult. Twenty-one is supposed to be the last milestone of young adulthood. It's the line in the sand that demarcates *before* and *after*. A concrete moment in time that soon slips past, and the years become quicksand draining to the bottom of the hourglass. There are no more deadlines to meet, just darkness at the finish line.

That treacherous darkness has crept up on us the same year we are turning twenty-two. The same year that was supposed to hold a college graduation, post-graduate travels, moving to a new city, starting a full-time job; now footnotes to an unfathomable tragedy of the commons. To come of age in truly the strangest of times. 

This year, of 2020, has been a typhoon of magic and misery. An agent of chaos that tore through the bedrock of every institution we thought we knew. A year of nothing but bad news and steeply-sloped curves. We have all written and spoken about it at length, and there will never be enough words for it; and furthermore, any attempt to summarize these events in a year-end reflection would be disingenuous. The wounds are still raw and reeling and the nation has never stopped bleeding. We may never recover from the ghosts of living in this haunted madhouse, but the least we can do is shut them in the attic, go downstairs to the living room couch, and watch the sparkling ball drop on the cusp of 2021. 

Back in May, I wrote [i need to get my story straight](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2020-05/all-of-a-sudden-i-miss-everyone) to get my own story straight about graduating virtually and the whirlwind of moving out, saying goodbye, and closing a chapter on life. It was one of the hardest things I've ever tried to write and it felt so important to me in the moment: the painful process of exorcising whatever leftover emotional baggage I had left in me in the words I could still find. Throughout the seven months and multiple lifetimes since I finished it, I come back to it and think about how little has changed. How fractured my emotional state had been at the time when I wrote it, how I had been so desperate to write my way out of my own feelings, and how the Elmer's glue didn't hold up when I held up the mirror at the end of December. 

At the end of December, in the minutes and few hours before the glistening mirrorball descends upon an empty Times Square, I find myself searching for answers to everything I had been missing and looking for this past year. Waiting for the crystal ball to drop and ordain our futures for the next year, the tea leaves of what 2021 may have in store for me now at twenty-two.

## **happy**

There's no preamble here about the meaning of happiness and whether it exists or how to attain it. We're all some combination of too disillusioned, despondent, and delirious to make sense of happiness and to know . 

It's about finding and creating joy where we can. These days, it's in the small things. Receiving a nice email in your inbox;

from a people who show up for you even when it's hard. I spent quarantine months figuring out what made me happy, because whatever I had up until that point wasn't quite doing it for me.

### free

Freedom as an oxymoron in the year the word "quarantine" entered the public consciousness and embedded itself into our national lexicon. No conversation could end without at least one reference to quarantine activities or feelings because it was on all of our minds and there was no point in beating around the bush. Days and months and nearly a year spent indoors as time melded into a messy mirage of bread-baking and Netflix binges. The headlines were a stream of white noise in the background, the torrential roar of crisis upon disaster upon tragedy.

This year was also the first time I felt free, in the cognitive and not physical sense. After I graduated in my living room and watched my photo flash on the tv screen for three seconds, I watched sixteen years of schooling collapse and had nothing to do and nowhere to go. I could do anything and everything (within the confines of my room and the wide-open internet); it seemed like I had infinite time to channel the restless, creative energy I had bottled up, much like releasing a genie from the bottle. Instead, I mostly did nothing. I thought a lot. I questioned, mulled over my thoughts and feelings and spent cycles spinning in circles. I read, but not as much as I would have liked. I caught up on all the YouTube videos, tv shows, and movies I never had enough time for and eagerly welcomed them as distractions. I went through phases of baking and crafting and every permutation of a productive hobby I could develop via an online tutorial. I did all those things and nothing much at all. 

It was the first time I was finally unencumbered by the institutions upon which I had validated myself and sought success. I had the privilege of freedom to think and mostly do as I wanted, yet couldn't help but feel trapped at the same time. It didn't make much sense, though I suspect that kind of cognitive dissonance isn't intended to make sense. There was so much I could do, and still so much work left to be done. The world was once so big and seemingly imploded overnight when those problems we had always swept aside sharpened and magnified into focus.

### lonely

This has been a lonely year. Lonely in the way where we've all been stuck inside of our homes during extended periods of self-quarantine—but also lonely in the way where you're supposed to be starting the rest of your life yet you're still sitting in your childhood bedroom and navigating each existential crisis beneath the soft glow of string lights. Lonely in the way where you're constantly surrounded by others on video calls and text messages. Blink once, and it's an empty room; blink twice, and it's no one but you and your face illuminated by the blue glow of the screen. Lonely as much as it is isolating.

Of course you *can* see people; but the sample size is limited and the variables are limitless. There is a guarded intimacy to a good, long video call. Physical space is bounded into rectangles side-by-side on a screen, morphed into the dreamscape backgrounds that hide our physical reality. Temporal bounds become demarcated by a timestamp that states how much time has passed since the call started, yet no time has passed at all. That desire social and emotional connection becomes whittled down into terse life updates and awkward icebreakers and occasional group therapy sessions for the soul. As gregarious creatures locked into a windowless room, 

I think I wanted to be angry at myself, but I'm not. A word from the unwise: you should never be angry with yourself; be gentle, be kind.

I have some resolutions for the new year. 



### **confused**

In May, we all became obsessed with *Normal People*. I, too, watched and read it, and then told my friends to do the same. Obama recommended in his year-end book list when 2019 was still on the cusp of becoming 2020, and Sally Rooney had been hailed as the literary voice of the millennial generation. I really wish I could stop talking about this book and show, and maybe I can finally lay it to rest after this one final thought: there is a good reason we keep coming back to it. We had more or less followed in the footsteps of Connell and Marianne: starting from those awkward teen years through the exploratory college years and all the way to the amorphous postgraduate years. We do the same things they did and caution ourselves against the same mistakes. They cite authors and texts they once read in university seminars—the syllabi and body of references that gave them the authority to reflect on socioeconomic stratification and racial disparity and systemic inequity in their own bubbles. 

That might just be a function of being twenty-two, but the causality is bleak. The point of it is: I don't think we want to know who we are. We self-diagnose and pick at our own scars until they start to bleed. 

Up until twenty-two, I was foremost a student—and now I'm just me. I don't really know who that is and there's not enough space here to articulate that in a pithy elevator pitch. I have things I care about, things I think a lot about, things I value and keep coming back to. Then I ask myself if all of that is enough in this day and age, in this iteration of myself, this confused imprint that keeps wondering and waiting. 

All the versions of myself before this year are largely volcanic ash now, preserved under the sediment of the months and years that have elapsed and exploded upon this year. The principles of my education forced me to learn and define who I was within those constructs, and now they no longer exist. I wonder who I am; and which parts of me I've sacrificed at the altar of my own expectations. Assuredly, every other recent high-achieving college graduate feels the same way; the shell of themselves at seventeen metamorphized into relentless self-possession at twenty-one (going on twenty-two). In the apocalyptic aftermath, I am learning how to learn, and unlearn, again. Learning is lifelong, and we know how long things can be.

<br />

I celebrated many twenty-second birthdays over Zoom this year. An entire generation of twenty-two year olds forged on the dignified stage of video chat. We made endearingly embarrassing birthday powerpoints, blasted Taylor Swift as loud as our tinny computer speakers would allow, and reminisced about the last time we were all in the same physical room together (and I'll think back to one of those perfect polaroid nights back in March and wonder where the time has gone since). I was the last to turn twenty-two, and by the time it was my turn, I had already memorized the chorus at age twelve and ready to let Taylor usher me into the next ceremonial stage of life. 

That's where I am now. Newly twenty-two—tired of a year of false promises, and eager for a new year of promising starts. Turned 22 in 2020; soon-to-be happier, freer, confused, and lonelier at 22 in 2021.
