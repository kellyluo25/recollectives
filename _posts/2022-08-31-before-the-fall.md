Another season is upon us. Taylor Swift announced a new album. I had trouble sleeping for a few weeks in August because I was overcaffeinated from green tea. I agonized over, then purchased an expensive memory foam pillow on a consumerist quest for better neck support. I watched the skies above the bay break open and rain on for a full Sunday afternoon. I contemplated what it meant to spend a year in one place, and interrogated the desire to upgrade all the little touches that make it closer to home.

At parties last fall, I'd ask *what keeps you up at night?* into the din of the room, an attempted shortcut into the inner psyche.

Here are things that keep me up at night.

## in the middle of the night

Another fall, another Taylor Swift album to spin cycles over. 






## the day job

I was asked recently



## staring out at the **midnight** sea

The nights are best for rabbit holes. For fixations. For hyperfixations. For things you can't stop thinking about even though you're pretty sure everyone else has moved on. That nobody cares about anymore, but still seizes you in the quiet late hours. 
- This mashup of *Perfect* and *Style* that perpetuates the mythic Harry Styles/Taylor Swift romance of 2013. This short-lived fling endures in the generational memory because these two songs, ostensibly written about one another, are so intoxicating when overlaid. It's a tease of what was, and a window into what could have been.
- The marriage between Leighton Meester and Adam Brody as two very normal people who started a family, but who also happened to star in the two greatest cultural institutions known to the modern millennia. It's the uncanny crossover of *Gossip Girl* and *The OC* that primetime melodrama could not script any better.

## does it ever drive you crazy ; just how fast the night changes?


In the fall:

- make a lavender-scented candle
- seal an envelope with hot wax
- mould a decorative object
- design a typographic poster
- acquire more postcards
- hike up a steeper hill

The weather will soon turn warmer, and I will rekindle the warmth of possibility.
