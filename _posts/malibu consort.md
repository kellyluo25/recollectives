the prince consort / malibu ken / ned nickerson etc thing

to remain, always, one pace behind. 


there's a scene in the first season of *The Crown,* where King George is sat next to Phillip on the dock. They've gone out bird hunting, as men do. The king implores (rather, insists) that Phillip's greatest duty is to: "Love her. Protect her. She is the job."

I once read something speculative from the POV of Ned Nickerson, de-facto boyfriend of sleuth extraordinaire, Nancy Drew. 

Is it so dissatisfying?
