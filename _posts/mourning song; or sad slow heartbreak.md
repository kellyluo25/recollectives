yahoo deleted all of my old emails from 2012-2016 and it felt like it deleted a piece of me (or set me free)



that part of me doesn't matter anymore. 

When I say I know what it's like to burn the midnight oil, I know what it's like to burn myself so completely to cinder, to ash. The timestamps crawl forward from midnight to 1:12am to 2:30am to 3:03am (a sequence of phone alarms went off around here, making sure I was still awake) to 4:50am to 6:12am. *I can't work on this anymore*, I'd shoot off in one last email before closing my computer, *or I'll be late*. Had to brush my teeth—had to get dressed—had to get on the subway and go to school—had to do so many things without any of the time. I think of those emails and I remember total exhaustion, penetrating numbness, enervated wasteland of a teenaged person. 

Sleep is a stupid thing to cry over. But I understand desperation as a feeling, so deeply in the maw of suffering. Gnawed through me, my flesh falling off the bone. To want sleep, but to be denied it again, and again, and again. I entertain this revisionist fantasy where someone came over to me by the fluorescent light of my desk and told me *it was okay to go to bed, it would all be fine to stop.* But nobody ever said that. A fantasy.

Pity party for a hunched-over fifteen year old girl, quietly sobbing, maybe praying; groveling, slurring *I'm so tired* into the silence. Needy, because she was made of lack. Because she was working on an assignment in a race against time and she hadn't slept in twenty-six hours. I don't know if I can write for her, or about her, without my heart breaking for her all over again. Maybe I should make a gesture of atonement; not sorry, but sympathetic. 

There is no validation in playing the *who-slept-less?* game. We all lose, anyway. Those losses compound, and I feel them sunken beneath my eyebags.

Those emails are gone. I'm still here. After all this time, isn't a miracle I managed to put myself back together? Scraped every piece of myself off the Chambers St. sidewalk and reassembled the remainders into *this* person. I can't believe it either.
