## this month

- **watching**: if i disappear for the next month or so, it's because i gave into the collective impulses of my digital feeds and started watching *house of the dragon*. and the lack of self-preservation that's caught up to me; and it'll hurt like hell. 
- **listened**: lorde, mitski, bleachers, lucy dacus. all in one saturday.
