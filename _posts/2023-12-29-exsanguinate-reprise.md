in all the ways i hoped i would be exculpated, i’m instead occupied by the intricacies of my own circulatory system. a true workhorse. keeps the acrimony and anxiety alive, pumping; not a place it cannot reach. upcycles guilt and self-approach anew. 

<br />
<br />
<br />
 

observe: garbage emotions. wasteland; wasted hope, wasteful grief.

depositions over time, built up like dunes, my fossils of eroded feelings. sanded down remains of the monolithic; too much to feel the full thing, so it trickles to the sediments. slippery, falls through fingers, can’t hold what i feel in my hands. untamable. 

<br />
<br />
<br />


throw me in the landfill, i once said. limbs and longing and all. bury me well, bless the dirt. beneath the crush, my compactions and compartments, unforgiven burdeno. under all this hurt may you still find a real person.

<br />
<br />
<br />
  

identify all the arteries from which hate springs eternal and let them flow. gushing, generously.

<br />
<br />
<br />
  

bile churn. sometimes i’m sick to my own stomach, all this sadness shoved down the esophagus—and told to stomach it, bear it out, let it break me down inside out.

<br />
<br />
<br />
  

don’t remember the last time i tried to pry myself open, phantom clawing, promised i’d never ask again.

<br />
<br />
<br />


can’t cauterize.

<br />
<br />
<br />
  

what the disreputed tradition of bloodletting forgot. purge of the caustic, seek catharsis as it pools down the drain.

####### was not happy with my first attempt at writing exsanguinate, which has always been such a profound literary influence to me. finding the exquisite in anatomical metaphors.
