###### inspired by seating charts (a silent act of care: saving a seat for someone)

i could make myself smaller, but i worry that creates too much space for you. take a seat. pull out this oaken windsor chair, slide into the plastic welded grooves of this bench, crawl onto the plush velvet of this chaise. if i shifted, left or right, i'd concentrate too hard on the permutations of airless contact. this is the anatomy of shoulder to elbow to fingertip. sitting in this still-life. i will puncture it with conversation, a bad joke. my eyes will dart upwards at the ceiling, bloom that unspoken thing beneath that undressed feeling. hope flush, immobile. (show me love; turn around your closed fist and open your palm and let me take a look at it)

###### new year, first fiction! 
non-goal for this year is to write more pretty bits of prose that don't mean anything. better here, in observance of evolving style, than treasure-kept by pen and paper.
