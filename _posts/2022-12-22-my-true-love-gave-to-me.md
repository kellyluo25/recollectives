###### **material girl** loves her material world, year 2022

My favorite guilty pleasure is the cult of TikToks that boast exclusive Amazon finds. For a few minutes of my time and under $30, I can have clearer skin, a nicer bathroom, a spotless kitchen. I am optimized. These short videos, slice of life, sing siren songs of attainment. At the bottom of the shopping cart is a better life, home, and self. I want to be better; if I spend the money, this genre says I can have something that looks like it all. Life gives lemons, and then I can be made. 

Marie Kondo has never inspected a credit card statement. Nothing has been so compelling to the modern sphere of commerce as a material girl with a credit card bearing her name. And nothing has so wholly transformed the solid edges of my existence as a few of my favorite thingsâ€”the things my fingers reach for, in the day and in the dark, grasping toward something greater. Everything within reach of my senses has a contour, an outline of my life rendered in shapes.

Sometimes I make a list of things I want to buy, and check it twice. Sometimes I surprise myself with how far I make it down the list; other times I recognize it is wise to compromise. This is the art of accumulation made sensible by ascribing appreciation to each material item. *is it so bad to want?* All we are, atomically, is wanting. I love all of these things, and being surrounded by them continues to spark joy. That feels like a rarity; and the rarities I've acquired this calendar year add to the sacred balance of environmental splendor:

- **lemon squeezer**: crush citrus halves to make a whole. dressings, custards, marinade.
- **patchwork blue armchair**: in the corner of my room rests my most acclaimed marketplace purchase. home to afternoons, curled into myself, writing collections.
- **trader joe's summer candle trio**: when summer fades into the haze of receding fog, san francisco still smells like watermelon mint.
- **air purifier with quiet sleep mode**: privilege should not have given me a fancy, app-controlled air purifier. clean air, as it ought to be, as it was for so much of organismal existence, as a common good.
- **miffy around the world** (colorized print): we're all from somewhere, belong nowhere. even these displaced cartoon animals encircling the globe.
- **soft duvet**: bury me under down feathers, nestled beneath woven european flax. my own warmth, a low-power human radiator, reflected back at me, keeping warm through the temperamental chill of bay area nights. 
- **shredded memory foam pillow**: never going back to any iteration of the pillow that doesn't encase little cubes of torn up foam. adjustable; firm yet supportive. 
- **cloudfoam comforts**: my aching city soles are cushioned on a platform bed of clouds. i have nowhere to go but on my two feet; they take me everywhere. with them, i'll be lost. 
- **straus organic plain whole milk yogurt**: sweet creamy tang. tastes like the closest thing to humid summers in guangzhou on this side of the pacific. break fast with a spoon of bay area honey; break open plastic spoons buried into tiny containers. 
- **backpack, nylon with gold hardware**: bears the brunt of my daily errands. sleek for work, roomy for travel. side pockets and a laptop sleeve as the bedrock of any commute. 
- **handheld steamer**: banish fabric wrinkles with the brandish of a hot plume of steam.  
- **dusty pink ottoman**: extra storage, but cushioned. since the fall, has really tied this place together. here to witness an unraveling, a sprawl, across the bench.
- **jackets x5**: purchased so many jackets in the span of a few days, fleece and fluff, all to keep me warm. sheltered and insulated against the elements.
- **wallet, redux:** recovering from the heartbreak of my previous loss (misplacement) with a new leather companion. the leather on this one is coarser, exposed; the lining is less floral. recovering after hard lessons that sometimes you love things and you can only love them until you lose them. 
- **stone diffuser**: jasmine is in the air again. fragranced ambiance as a interior setpiece.

(*i'll stop here for now, before capital christmas sinks its claws (*claus*) in further*)
