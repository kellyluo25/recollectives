I love winter. I love the way the frost clings to surfaces with an unyielding attachment, the way the cold works its way into your bones and wonâ€™t let out. Winter is bitter and unrelenting, and it has a sinister and unsuspecting way of creeping up on you. A biting chill that rattled your insides and stayed past its welcome.
