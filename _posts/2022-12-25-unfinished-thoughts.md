###### collections: a weekly reset



On this date.

- **half-baked, inchoate thoughts**: why do we always preemptively disclaim our personal opinions by saying they're not fully formed? (i do it too)

- **i grew up too quick and i still forgive too slow**

- **my youtube playlist mixtape**

- **attic-dwellers that live rent-free**: the things i should start charging rent for in my mind

- **the genius of spotify playlists**

- **on saturday we're sad girls**

- i find myself enraptured by the desolation of my own self-image

idk people are being really defensive and self-insert about the romance novel.

I started thinking about this because I took the misinformed recommendation of the Goodreads Best Books list (okay, so I don't actually learn from my mistakes) and read Emily Henry's *Beach Read* when I really should've left it in the TBR pile for another year and a half. This book exploits the trauma plot, mines it for every bit of the conflict catalysis and miscommunication its worth, and resolves by disemboweling their main leads of any personality. As in, they are not peoople aside from their orientation and reaction to their trauma. 

The meta-point is that this is a romance novel wherein the main character is a romance novelist and she fervidly defends her craft.

Writers who insert writers (aspiring, burnt out, retired, etc) as their leads.
