## not the marriage plot

###### what the fuck is the romance genre anyway

idk people are being really defensive and self-insert about the romance novel.

I started thinking about this because I took the misinformed recommendation of the Goodreads Best Books list (okay, so I don't actually learn from my mistakes) and read Emily Henry's *Beach Read* when I really should've left it in the TBR pile for another year and a half. This book exploits the trauma plot, mines it for every bit of the conflict catalysis and miscommunication its worth, and resolves by disemboweling their main leads of any personality. As in, they are not peoople aside from their orientation and reaction to their trauma. 

The meta-point is that this is a romance novel wherein the main character is a romance novelist and she fervidly defends her craft.

Writers who insert writers (aspiring, burnt out, retired, etc) as their leads.

beach read was kind of a terrible book
