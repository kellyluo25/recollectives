today is not tuesday poetry; but rather a collection of poems i'll never finish. in the spirit of anti-completionism, i'm excerpting partial-phrases from my notebook at various points in the year. one of the greatest joys and crushing defeats of having an archive of past writing is realizing that so much of it is unfulfilled potential: scraps of beautiful prose that never found a home or a proper resolution. but it's also gratifying to return to words that you wrote down once because they sounded pleasant, and to find a reminder that they're just as lovely with mild age. to see where these could-be stories started and stopped.

*q:*
***would you give me your heart if i asked for it?***

*a:*
my blades are left-handed  

but right hand over my fucking heart,  

i would have cut it out  

for you, myself

if only you had asked

<br />
it would have hurt

less.

they said the old gods bled ichor, 
honey-wine and sweet gold, 
but you, child, are no godâ€”
when you bleed, 
you bleed out.

**this is a poem about how to save a life**

call for a three-numbered siren,
wait for the ambulance, 
list out the the signs and symptoms

you hold hands over the gurney, 
check the vital signs twice.
