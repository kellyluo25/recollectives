find me: marooned. splintered against the crag.

so badly wanted [the last time](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2022-11/this-is-the-last-time) to be a long time ago. was a completely different person then, attention-starved, greedy. emotional, nearly anorexic.

everything is a haunting. that cracked feeling. chapped lips and ashen elbows. overexposure. gaping flesh wound. spoils of a warchest. looted open, pillaged bare. picked-at, picked-over, picked-prometheus.
