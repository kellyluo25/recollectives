Sleepless nights when I try to make sense of the confused chaos of my own brain. These are the hours when I think about: 

- why we can't let teen girls like things and the _purchasing power_ they command once their wallets are valuable
- skewed perception of fiscal value and monetary services, until one day we learn about _wall street_ and everything changes
- the implicit generational trauma of being a child of the internet, information overload and polarization unbound.
