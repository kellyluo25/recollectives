Sleepless nights when I try to make sense of the confused chaos of my own brain. These are the late hours when I think about: 

- why we can't let teen girls like things and the _purchasing power_ they command once their wallets are valuable
- skewed perception of fiscal value and monetary services, until one day we learn about _wall street_ and everything changes
- the implicit generational trauma of being a *child of the internet*, information overload and polarization unbound.
- the fuzzy edges of my consciousness from self-aware to world-aware in a house of cards newscycle: that post 9-11, kindergarten during katrina, elementary school financial crisis *state of mind*.
