I've been taking long walks and drafting stupid little pretty bits of prose I don't know what to do with. When I read, I'll also jot down little phrases I find stunning—low-voltage shocks to the system; makes me stop in my tracks and reach for my notebook to record in deference, in awe that someone had concocted this exact elixir of language—and then I'll return to them as a font of borrowed inspiration. These are the working cogs of my interiority now: turning over words and pairing them with others until something clicks and I find the low hum of a satisfactory rhythm. Poor poetry, but not quite. 


### **bruised** **banks**
*i had blood drawn and watched a bruise form in my inner elbow and it made me think about the most delicate, accessible parts of the human body and the big miracle of our biological trauma response. in the literary sense, writing about the bruise is universal. now playing: "bruises" by chairlift*

to be bruised from within. lumps of words, crawling to carve out spaces where they shouldn't exist, where there was no room to begin with. lodged within and malformed. impaled. vicious mortal spear. i fear we have been made to see inside ourselves. impress upon it, tighten the grip. tender blossoms beg for a bouquet arrangement. (not to be confused with the following: an ache, a wound, a scab). 



### solar powered
*two months later, i found this draft during a sunrise on an amtrak.*

(what does the sun look like?) dazzling. cosmic. blinding. 

looking at you; like, looking at the sun. 

overloaded. unapologetic. 

never stare directly into the sun. solar rays destroy another spoke of the cornea. it is a pulsing, accidental hurt. it will take years to reveal. 

(what do we do around the sun?) orbit. trace a familiar path, over and over, about ourselves. contort the forces that holds one together to trail after you. one foot, then the other; one day, then the next. until the days accumulate to a year, and the orbit dips into another year. revolutions.
