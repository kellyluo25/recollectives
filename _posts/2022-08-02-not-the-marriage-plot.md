# not the marriage plot

## leading

The second season ofÂ _Bridgerton_Â works not because of the sweeping diaphanous gowns or the high-pitched pop string quartetsâ€”but because it respects the genre it was borne from. The singular, most spectacular aspect of Jonathan Baileyâ€™s performance is how he understands the gravity of playing a leading man in the romance genre. He doesnâ€™t sneer at it or regard the character as beneath him. He takes his role as seriously as he would if he were debuting an avant-garde play on the West End. Thereâ€™s a gravitational pull in his artistic sincerity, and that gives his performance the weight it needs to transcend the patent frivolity.

There is tension and terror in his eyes, sparkles of agony and affection that simmer. His face crumples in multiple scenes, if itâ€™s one of those phrases someone sees in writing and doesnâ€™t understand how it maps to the plane of a human face, but then its visualized so profoundly in moments of devastation.

## legibility

Legibility. Meaning readable, to the point of comprehension. The ability to string together signals and form a conclusion at the end of it.

Making yourself legible to someone.


## revivals

The romance genre makes complete sense. The genre is long-ridiculed for its saccharine camp, as if itâ€™s completely foolish to watch two people fall in love. Also, girls love romcoms; and god forbid girls like anything as unserious and asinine as romanceâ€”and thereâ€™s nothing less serious than people navigating the complicated landmine of human love.

Logical girls love romcoms. Romcoms contradict the regemine of regulated emotion and compartmentalized feelings of the real world, and let loose in the structured chaos of a fictional one. The Greeks understood this contradiction in the art of theatre, allowing the stage to purge the darkest of human emotion and play out the fantasy of a hypothetical. A romance film is a tightly structured container of disastrous feelings. Endless angst and self-contrived obstacles stand in the way to contentment. Spending time immersed in this environment is a cathartic exercise, a purge of someone elseâ€™s problems and predicaments.

Thereâ€™s something to logic out of the mired pit of messy human emotion that swells. Love as that elusively universal thing that seems impossible to make sense of, but these stories are practice runs of tragic trials and comedic errors. Itâ€™s watching two people make mistakes and feel things and dig themselves out of their stubbornness to find something greater than themselves. Itâ€™s watching two ignorantly destined individuals, circle around each other even when there is a clearly charted course they could take.

Watching a romcom is putting together a puzzle in movie-time; thereâ€™s no mystery to the final picture, just the challenge of finding the right combination of pieces. The genre tropes are a rolodex of possibility, some more probable than others, and lay out paths along logic tree that converge to a common point: happily ever after. Every look or line imparts directional clues, filed away in a sociological reference book of how people act under emotional distress. Every action has a corresponding reaction; read enough romance novels and eventually the characters and situations write themselves.

There is immense comfort in the predictability. These genres are how the hyper-logical try to exercise control over the uncertainty of human relationships.
