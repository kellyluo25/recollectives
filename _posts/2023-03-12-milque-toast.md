toast is best enjoyed: 
- exposed, caramelized in a convection oven. some, but not too much color. golden. maillard as an act of love. 
- in the mornings, with a pot of honeyed tea.
- fresh seasonal strawberries, lush whipped cream. crust cut off, halved into triangles. 
- tangzhong. thick. tasty. 
- open-faced canvas for avocado green with a sprinkle of flaky salt, rain of lemon. warm yolk, broken.
- just a small, spare pat of butter.
- crunchy, crusted. delicate prosciutto ruffles, fig jam dress.
- at this open, airy cafe in the middle of ginza. breaking bread as a centrepiece.
