At the start of this year, I said *I wanted to write more*. It was more of an aspiration than a resolution, but what's aspiration without a little inspiration?

Here's the plan: at the end of every week, I'll block off thirty minutes to an hour on my calendar. I'll write about what I thought about that week, spinning aberrant thoughts into a periodical narrative. I'll post it.

This isn't a newsletter in the formal sense  (I'm not a newsletter writer, nor do I really want to be). It'll be more like a semi-public diary. Some of these will be half-formed ideas that I have been nurturing; others will be full essays I want to write one day but lack the energy and motivation to do so.

I'm always thinking about something, and I mean this in the way that I care and pay attention a lot of things and they have the luxury of taking up space in my brain. I'll take any opportunity to pathologize my inner thoughts and reason through my neuroses. A lot of this will be captured through the lens of my relationship with technology and the internet. The kind of armchair sociocultural anthropologist that pays homage to her tools and instruments.
