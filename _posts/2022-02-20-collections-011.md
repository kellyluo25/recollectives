###### collections: a semi-seasonal reset

We're in the double digits and that's a marvel. I'm doing the *writerly* thing where instead of writing about anything of substance, I'm writing about the things I've read and writing itself. Because writing makes you fundamentally opinionated about how the words are smithed.

- **interior pith**: the last time i wrote fiction was 2018
- **interior pith:** identity crises on the page
- **not the marriage plot**: in defense of the romance genre

## interior pith

In the best and worst of my teen years, I wrote a lot of fiction. Mostly short sketches of situations and characters, anything I could plot down within one to two pages of a Word document and abandon forever. It was easier then than it is now. It was easier to dream up people and places interacting when I had an inchoate sense of how the world worked (and those senses are still nascent, for the record). So imagined it was almost real. When I dig back into my archives, I roll my eyes in the *can you believe I wrote this* kind of way, at the cloying and saccharine sentiments of purple prose. The prose is still purple, but hopefully a sharper mauve these days. I've impatiently migrated those words across many third-party services over the yearsâ€”from blogspot to tumblr to whatever newsletter platform is the rageâ€”and I've settled for a simple markdown editor in the present. I'll notice the time stamp (eight years ago), and the time is gone but the words stand still. 

I can't even describe 

fiction vs non-fiction

having lived experiences

boggled by our own lives



When I realized this, my first instinct was to find something to write about. I started up another doc and drafted the beginnings and arcs (but I never get to the end) of more half-written vignettes. 



## interior pith

In writing this, there's the internet's context collapse, but within that house of cards is also the identity collapse. I surfaced two pieces from my backlog: Parul Seghal's keenly-observed "[The Case Against the Trauma Plot](https://www.instapaper.com/read/1471005350/18660659)" and Brandon Taylor's blithe response, "[emotional support trauma plot](https://blgtylr.substack.com/p/emotional-support-trauma-plot)," which I may have enjoyed reading more than the original.





"Fiction is, I think, always kind of about the shock of human experience. The shock of being alive."



this is the part against psychologization 



## not the marriage plot

###### what the fuck is the romance genre anyway

idk people are being really defensive and self-insert about the romance novel.

I started thinking about this because I took the misinformed recommendation of the Goodreads Best Books list (okay, so I don't actually learn from my mistakes) and read Emily Henry's *Beach Read* when I really should've left it in the TBR pile for another year and a half. This book exploits the trauma plot, mines it for every bit of the conflict catalysis and miscommunication its worth, and resolves by disemboweling their main leads of any personality. As in, they are not peoople aside from their orientation and reaction to their trauma. 

The meta-point is that this is a romance novel wherein the main character is a romance novelist and she fervidly defends her craft.

Writers who insert writers (aspiring, burnt out, retired, etc) as their leads.

beach read was kind of a terrible book

romance podcasts i guess
