*give me back my girlhood (it was mine first)*


Barbie Roberts is a platonic ideal. She set the aspirational bar and then raised it in her highest heels. 

Barbara is a blue-eyed, blonde-haired gem of a girl. Limitless, nearly unfathomable. A miracle that someone like her should exist. But you can call her *Barbie.* She'd prefer it that way. Like you're old friends, in the way her name rolls off the tongue with a familiar fondness.

Barbie will throw open the double French doors of her home and invite you in. Warmly. She loves hosting, and with this home, she's not shy about showing it off. Before there were 73 Questions with Vogue or [Open Door with Architectural Digest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKgaVlMN7IY), there was a Dreamhouse. The Dreamhouse was a homeowner's paradise built with interlocking layers of brittle polymers: brightly textured sheets of plastic with stickered-facades to convey deeper depths. The furniture was always more form than functional; it mattered more that she owned a chaise than her ability to lounge in it. It was built for modularity, to be easily assembled and packed up at the end of a play date. Collapsed and hidden away from prying eyes. It stood tall among the toy box landscape, a permanent fixture in the imagination. This was Barbie's world: everyone else was simply passing through as a visitor. 

Life in the Dreamhouse is sickly-sweet. There is a pool, generally top floor with a water slide to the ground. A fuchsia Malibu convertible is parked right outside, windows down. An elevator spans multi-stories when the spiral staircase becomes too exhausting. Not to forget the expansive closet space worthy of a fashionista's wardrobe. To follow the [architectural evolution](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/23/realestate/barbie-dreamhouse.html) of the Dreamhouse is to chase the elusive American dream of homeownership. Barbie's home shapeshifts with the times, reflecting back the A-frames of 60s or McMansions of the 90s. In the most recent media adaptations, the Dreamhouse is the futuristic smart home that never was: an interconnected matrix of beeping gadgets and responsive appliances that anticipate every need and answer every call. It's all so easy. As a single, near-ageless young woman, Barbie stood as a homeowner rather than a homemaker. She was not set dressing for the interior; she was not waiting for her husband to come home. Her pink fingerprints were all over the set piece. It was all hers, and it signaled to all the little girls who could afford that miniature that they could have bigger, better, best someday too. Just like Barbie.

I wasn't bothered by the fact that Barbie didn't look like me, in any version of her. Of all the permutations of Barbie on the glossy pre-recession shelves of Toys 'R Us, there was no one for me, like me, to look up to. But I think I ought to be more alarmed by how I was so willing to pull apart pieces of myself in ofference, of barter and exchange. I didn't care that I didn't look like her; not when I wanted to shape myself closer. Pressed my face against the glass and hoped I'd stop seeing my own reflection in the mirror. Less of this, more of that. 





All these little pebbles and mishappen rocks and heavy stones accumulated onto her person: curled into permed wavy locks; sewn into the folds of her skirt; weighed into soles of the underfoot. 



During the pandemic, locked away in the tower of my childhood bedroom, I spent many of my indoor hours watching the late 2010's *Barbie's Dreamhouse Adventures* on Netflix. The show rendered Barbie and friends in a vivacious animation style for thirty minutes every episode: slices of a perfect life with an occasional wrench that would be inevitably smoothed out with extra persistence and an unerring belief in social bonds. Pandemic life was a distorted time capsule that reminded us all that we never really grew up. 

My Barbies are all gone now. Donated to a younger cousin across the Pacific who probably doesn't quite grasp the treasures she has in her possession. I owned four, all gifted by my aunts, and I had a stack ranking of my favorites based on how wieldy their hair was. I named them at some point, then kept changing the names because the monikers never stuck.
