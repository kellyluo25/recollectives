All I do is remix memory; the seasons have always been my time-keeper. 

2021 · The long, limbic hibernation ended. Left home, settled into a second home near the park. The fog rolled in. Rearranged cheap furniture, put up postcards on a white wall. Ordered dinner (indoors, finally) with different people, different nights. The hills came alive. Stood solitary on an ocean cliffside, and (*spoiler*) this moment is retold as an origin story. 

2022 · Wrote poetry, on a Tuesday. Showed up at font doors with pillowy loaves of focaccia. Woke up for a five a.m. promenade, dug my high heels into dirt, took photos for the family photo album. Wondered if this is how it would have felt when this still meant everything. Don’t know when I stopped searching for closure, two years late.

A year as a crucible. I was so eager to make myself anew, but had never sculped without a reference image.

A formlessness that made me question if I only ever knew how to take the shape of my containers.
