though we may be grieving for the past few february weeks spent writing in the desolate winter, the 29th is a special leap day that comes with the promise of a new spring. for one day every four years, we stand in abeyance until we see the spring sun rise in the blue sky once again. we find our temporary respite in a dream of spring, a safe harbor among the turbulent seas of the winter nightmare.
