###### gossip girl was the greatest show of our generation: ***the prologue***

<br />

If you know anything about me, you know that I hold a deep reverence for *gossip girl*.

I'm serious: the collective of post-*gossip girl* society thinks and behaves in a completely different way because of this show that premiered on the CW in September of 2007. (September 19th, 2007 at 9/8c to be exact.)

I sat down to write my magnum opus on why *gossip girl* was the greatest show, period. This isn't that post.*

<br />

They don't make shows like this anymore. By all counts, *gossip girl* was a terrible show—mired in melodrama and misery–but I stand by the first season of the show as the pinnacle of modern television. I cannot, in good conscience, defend any season after the first. 

*gossip girl* was lightening in a Moët bottle: a pre-during-post meditation on the recession generation; the rich (always) getting richer; our young, budding relationship to the internet and to each other in the anonymity of cyberspace; media creation and consumption at the precipice of pixel-driven virality; a parody of celebrity before it became unchecked influence; smudged fingerprints of gilded-age wealth as the axis of capital itself has shifted; beautiful, photogenic people basically getting away with murder; the city of new york at a reckoning with itself; the kind of super rich kid problems that feel down to earth and detached in outer space; elitism and classism and all the -isms that are trivial to the people at the top; and the rest of us at the bottom, longingly watching from our voyeuristic vantage point of aspiration.

The music in *gossip girl* was a visceral stylistic choice (listen: [this spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LS331Ne16mF0LoD1VGw9H?si=085bae754212401b)). This show was glamorous, glitzy, and golden: covered in lush excess, but beating with a real heart underneath. In the post-indie rock of the early 2000s to emergent edm-influenced pop of the late 2000s, emerged Josh Schwartz-produced television as a vehicle for musical discovery.

*I'm not quite there yet, but perhaps I'll gather these thoughts on paper when I'm feeling particularly sharp pangs of nostalgia during the season finale of the reboot.)
