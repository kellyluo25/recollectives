        <p><em>why i’m worried about the future of tv.</em></p>

<p>normally, this week would be tv upfronts season—but since that’s no longer physically possible, i’m worried the tv industry won’t survive these times.</p>

<p>upfronts are the splashy events held by major tv networks three weeks into may to showcase their upcoming show programming and garner advertising interest. it’s one of the most exciting weeks of my year (it’s heaven for a tv nerd like me) because we get a sneak preview of all the new pilots and shows that we can anticipate in the fall. the bulk of ad spend for tv happens “up front,” so most of the tv advertising money moves during these upfronts events and dictates the health of the network for the coming year.</p>

<p>this year, we don’t have upfronts.</p>

        <p>We love our milkshakes. It’s <em>the</em> drink that screams Americana, from the whipped cream and literal cherry on top.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is patriotism, but nostalgia for the foods of our youth?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently, I’ve been feeling very <strong>nostalgic</strong>. The extended time at home has stirred that yearning for the past, for younger years. It’s inspired by the craving for the foods I grew up on, the music that filled my afternoons, and the stories that shaped the way I see the world.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p><em>or: why riverdale could have been a much better show than it is</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of my favorite late night pasttimes is to watch YouTube compilations of <em>Riverdale</em> scenes. They are absolutely excoriating. I have spent so many hours thinking about how <em>Riverdale</em> could have been a better show. A much better show than whatever mess the writers are trying to pass off as melodrama with a cherry on top. To be frank, I haven’t seen an episode of Riverdale since the season 1 finale. I couldn’t get past the choppy pacing and chopped-up characters.</p>

<p>This show could have been incredible. It was sitting on a goldmine of potential, and its devoted teen audience has seen that storytelling potential waste away over the years. For however many more seasons the CW keeps renewing this show for, it won’t quite ever recover what the show could have been. Season 1, especially the pilot episode, felt ambient and precipitous. It felt like it was on the edge of something great and we were lucky enough to watch it unfold before us.</p>

        <p><strong>tigertail</strong> (dir. alan yang) was beautiful and poignant in the way you come home after a long day and allow yourself to slowly unwind in the silence. the film soaks in the quiet, recognizes that there aren’t always words to say what you mean, and visually renders those moments to speak louder than the script. it’s not a perfect film, but it is a poignant one. stop on any frame, and you see a sketch of yourself and your family in the mirror. these are a few things that made the film so resonant:</p>

<ol>
  <li>recognizing that the homeland is so bright and vibrant, yet so unbearable. our parents, grandparents all started somewhere—some version of that same concrete house and barely-paved dirt road.</li>
  <li>the monotony and loneliness of arriving somewhere new, unanchored. trying to put down roots in a place when you’re not sure it wants you.</li>
  <li>the sacrifices and choices we make so that someday we end up with a house on american soil. when does that stop being the dream? when did it stop for pin jui?</li>
</ol>

<p>it’s pin jui sitting with a cup of tea in his dining room, alone in a big house. it’s angela with a half-eaten meal, wishing her father would say something. it’s the two of them together, framed side-by-side by a concrete block at the end.</p>

<p>this film was alan yang’s way of producing a careful study of his own father, vivid in color and pensive in thought. it makes you want to stop and study your parents too; think about where they came from and what they have to say too.</p>

        <p><strong>moving portraits:</strong> a series about how the online and offline interact and collide</p>

<p><em>Living memory, as told through live performances.</em></p>

<p>Live performance is a dialogue. It is a magical, unspoken conversation that connects the performer with each member of that audience. It is the connection that stays with you in physical space, forged through the visual, auditory, and tactile sensory input that is only possible by experiencing the performance/demonstration in a real, live setting. The relevance of live performance is to build that connection between observer and art, but also to initiate the live dialogue that occurs after. There is something special at the conclusion of a performance when you have a chance to react, process what you have seen, and reflect with those around you about what you have just experienced. Those conversations often cement the value and significance of the performance; and that reflection transforms a live performance into an experience and a memory that is enriching, immersive, and above all, timeless.</p>
