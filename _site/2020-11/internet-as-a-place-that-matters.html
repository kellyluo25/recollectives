    <p>a generation raised by the internet. growing up in a digital headspace with bodies in a physical world. coming of age with the internet as the internet came of age itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it reminds you of another time in your life when online was the only thing that mattered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>essays that i will someday (start and) finish writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>signed by screenname</strong>: the selection of a screenname as a signature of ourselves, the multiplicity of our many names, and forks of our digital identity scattered to the winds.</li>
  <li><strong>lowercase legacies</strong>: all-lowercase writing as a structural condition for internet cognition and communication.</li>
  <li><strong>the making of an aesthetic</strong>: the ~ aesthetic ~ as digital ambiance, how they’re formed and take shape, and design as a visual language of the online.</li>
  <li><strong>online blues: #36465D vs #001935</strong>: tumblr as a genre-defining cornerstone of the internet; how that indie internet conciousness has somehow elevated to the mainstream.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-theory-of-digital-relativity">the theory of digital relativity</h2>
<p><em>we’re all writing about the digital world and how we’re just living in it</em></p>

<h4 id="signed-by-screenname">signed by screenname</h4>
<p>the screenname as a performance of our digital identity that contain the multitudes of who we are as individuals and the complex lives we lead in and outside of the virtual landscape. the way our names take on multiformations depending on where we are and who we’re talking to. and how these screennames are scattered throughout our online presence like difference faces of the same person.</p>

<h4 id="lowercase-legacies">lowercase legacies</h4>
<p>how writing in all-lowercase (case in point) became an extension of a lifestyle in the post-2016 internet. how stylistic choice in expression and convenience became a linguistic phenomenon. but as the sapir-whorf hypothesis says, the structure of a language inherently affect our worldview and cognition. what’s life when everything’s in lowercase?</p>

<h4 id="the-making-of-an-aesthetic">the making of an aesthetic</h4>
<p>aesthetics as digital ambiance. maybe it’s how the dusty pastels meet pantone swatches, or the thick serif type meets the occasional slab accent. or maybe it’s the blindings neons and bold geometry, minimized by pixels and sharpened by distortion. what are the forms and factors that turn a visual into a style that is recognizable and pervasive on the internet?</p>

<h4 id="36465d-vs-001935">#36465D vs #001935</h4>
<p>how that weird teen consciousness that emerged on tumblr in the early 2010s has transformed what we know of modern culture today through its uncanny prescience, useful anonymity, and unparalleled in-jokes.</p>
