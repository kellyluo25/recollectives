<p>It appears that a weekly newsletter has now turned seasonal. An unfortunate, but not irreversible problem. Every so often, I‚Äôll have a stray, aberrant thought that I‚Äôll jot into my drafts and never release into the world. At some point, it may be useful to stop thinking about those as aberrations and give them the space to exist as fully-formed ideas. As they say, publishing something is better than nothing; no use in waiting for me to publish the next one.</p>

<h6 id="august-slipped-away-into-a-moment-in-time">august slipped away into a moment in time</h6>

<p>The curse continues. You should have seen it coming. You really should‚Äôve known.</p>

<p>This year is when optimism goes to die; this year is when you finally let yourself want for something again and the desire gets squeezed out of you; this year is when hope became that dangerous thing because you found yourself dangling on the precipice of complacency.</p>

<p>Sometimes you don‚Äôt know any better, because the times give you the sign that things will get better. I‚Äôd look you in the eye and tell you how much I believed in you. And if coping mechanisms picked favorites, sublimation would be the golden child. Thermodynamics may have opinions about how the world works, but the second rule asserts entropy must increase‚Äîand we are most certainly in a closed system. When you let yourself feel it, you sublimate.</p>

<p>I can tell you what the front of the postcard would have looked like. Signed from another state, sealed with sun-stuck fingers. I can tell you what all of these postcards would have looked like: snapshots of a memory I never had and places I had never been. I can describe them in the same vivid, pedantic detail you would recite if you were studying for an art history lesson and reimaging someone else‚Äôs vision in your mind‚Äôs eye. This was the real thing, they say, and you nod along as if it made all the sense in the world. As if you had been there too.</p>

<p>On the back of the postcard, I would have written it down. Everything we saw, the way I felt; and maybe, just maybe, I‚Äôd have something to remember it by. False memories are the sublimated experiences of a life unlived. The thing is, they give you a receipt when you cancel too. They don‚Äôt let you forget that either. Here is the souvenir; goodbye and goodnight. Come again next year.</p>

<p>The very, very last thing I want you to know is: I‚Äôll probably do it all again.</p>

<p>Disclaimer, I‚Äôve been to Jersey maybe twice voluntarily.</p>

<p>With the release of Lorde‚Äôs new album, <em>Solar Power</em>, there‚Äôs a strange media phenomenon where her success and musicality is centered on the producer: on Jack Antonoff, the venerated pop producer that has made music with some of the biggest stars in the industry over the past few years. Gone are the days of Jack playing second fiddle to the lead of fun. (long live the fleeting, bright star that was <em>the</em> breakdout indie darling of a decade past), and also the days where he was inextricably coupled with Lena Dunham (a whirlwind romance forever preserved in the liner notes of Taylor‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou are in Love‚Äù). He is a producer with a reputation and multiple Grammys that precede him; he is the first call for so many of the pop powerhouses by the name of Taylor, Lorde, Lana, and so many more.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not here to talk about Jack‚Äôs collaborations and his role as a producer. I‚Äôm here to talk about him as an artist as the frontman of Bleachers. I‚Äôm here to talk about how I fell deep in the rabbithole of his sonic universe because his music was texturally recreating these feelings of youth and yearning that feel all too familiar in an internal world. And actually, I‚Äôm here to talk about this singular musical performance of Jack Antonoff with his acoustic guitar, perched atop a wooden stool, and straddling the green line of the tunnel that separates the York from Jersey.</p>

<p><em>Take the sadness out of Saturday night</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZYMkr6-_0k">Jack sings</a>, his body positioned more in the half that is New Jersey than it is New York. Without exhaustively recapitulating the Bleachers discography, it sounds like this: it sounds like sadly having the time of your life; wondering what happened at the party you were never invited to; nodding when someone asks why you‚Äôre crying and you insist you‚Äôre the happiest you‚Äôve ever been; walking by the empty swings of a park you‚Äôve been to since a child yet feeling overgrown.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the soundtrack of that undescribable‚Äî<em>you are the main character of your life</em>‚Äîfeeling buried beneath snare drums and synthesizer.</p>

<p>His music gets that feeling. He gets that sense of being young and wanting everything, but having nothing: the blind cavernous, courage of desire matched with the disappointing grace of mundanity. The DNA of it feels inherently Jersian: an inferiority complex built on the outskirts of the big, glamourous New York City. The sort of fully-realized person you always imagined yourself to be, yet always coming up short. There is this immense sadness to being on the outside looking at the shiny and big apple of a city just one underground car ride over. Knowing you could be bold and great too (that the capacity has always been there; and the green line is arbitration), but you humble yourself and exclaim reminders that you love where you came from: a guitar and wooden stool, tunnel and traffic be damned.</p>

</ul>

<p>Eventually, I‚Äôll write something real about this song.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a sonic memory embedded in this web of me trying to parse how my <em>girl</em>hood processed into <em>teenage</em>hood and then phased into the young <em>woman</em>hood that faces me today, the sum of all these years intertwined and collapsed. My own existential vertigo.</p>
