        <p>a generation raised by the internet. growing up in a digital headspace with bodies in a physical world. coming of age with the internet as the internet came of age itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it reminds you of another time in your life when online was the only thing that mattered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>essays that i will someday (start and) finish writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>signed by screenname</strong>: the selection of a screenname as a signature of ourselves, the multiplicity of our many names, and forks of our digital identity scattered to the winds.</li>
  <li><strong>lowercase legacies</strong>: all-lowercase writing as a structural condition for internet cognition and communication.</li>
  <li><strong>the making of an aesthetic</strong>: the ~ aesthetic ~ as digital ambiance, how they’re formed and take shape, and design as a visual language of the online.</li>
  <li><strong>online blues: #36465D vs #001935</strong>: tumblr as a genre-defining cornerstone of the internet; how that indie internet conciousness has somehow elevated to the mainstream.</li>

        <p>we all have these—the thoughts that won’t leave our brain. the things we spend a lot of time thinking about. half-baked musings that can keep us up at night or fill the blank pages of journals and blogposts. the conversations we have without ourselves about what matters to us and what we believe of the world.</p>

<p>and i’m still looking for the words to say the things i mean. someday, i might find them. for now, they exist as inklings of the connective synapses that map and connect these thoughts together:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>lifestyle genres</strong>: an ode to our constant coming of age</li>
  <li><strong>cultural artifacts</strong>: the stories we keep coming back to</li>
  <li><strong>national geography</strong>: places and what they mean to a people</li>
  <li><strong>compositional interaces</strong>: fault lines between the real and unreal</li>
</ul>

<p><em>these are the things i’ve spent my whole life trying to put into words</em></p>

        <p>tones of the earth, some vermillion and ochre, the remnants of burnt terra cotta. paint the canvas sidewalks with pigments of past-lives. bare trees, naked branches. the hard crunch of dead leaves beneath rubber soles of laced-up boots. cyclic reminders that the giants shed their skin too; cower to their own survival instincts. crisp air, warm cinnamon. some things end before they can begin again.</p>

<p>There’s a lightbulb moment that happens. You hear the magical words product management and a switch goes off in your brain. You see the venn diagram with three interlocking circles and decide you want to be at the exact center of it—tech, business, design.</p>

<p>Here are two truths and a lie I wish I knew before I started:</p>

        <p>when the greeks invented the word for myth, they found a place for all the stories they told and would continue to tell for years to come. when they found mythology, they also found logos. the infinite logic of trying to make sense of our own chaos as a people.</p>

<p>i’ve always been fascinated by the personal myths we keep close, woven into the fabric of our own folklore. i’m still working on piecing together the stories i tell myself. the stories we keep repeating even if we know the ending, because maybe this time it will be different. change the lyrics, the setting, the characters.</p>

<p>i can’t recall how many times i’ve listened to taylor swift’s surprise folk-pop album <em>folklore</em> since it dropped on midnight, july 24th. who knew the interminable summer of 2020 would coalesce into a surprise autumn from taylor swift? if folklore is a collection of taylor’s stories, then it’s worth studying why her folklore are the tales that are passed down and whispered around.</p>
