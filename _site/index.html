        <p>when the greeks invented the word for myth, they found a place for all the stories they told and would continue to tell for years to come. when they found mythology, they also found logos. the infinite logic of trying to make sense of our own chaos as a people.</p>

<p>i’ve always been fascinated by the personal myths we keep close, woven into the fabric of our own folklore. i’m still working on piecing together the stories i tell myself. the stories we keep repeating the same stories even if we know the ending, because maybe this time it will be different. change the lyrics, the setting, the characters.</p>

<p>i can’t recall how many times i’ve listened to taylor swift’s surprise folk-pop album <em>folklore</em> since it dropped on midnight, july 24th. who knew the interminable summer of 2020 would coalesce into a surprise autumn from taylor swift? if folklore is a collection of taylor’s stories, then it’s worth studying why her folklore are the tales that are passed down and whispered around.</p>

        <p>sickly sweet. swelters and scorches, almost cruel. melted popsicles and lopsided ice cream cones. sun-baked stories. some of them you repeat for years to come, some of them you never speak of again. feet in the sand, anchored in coarse grains of rock and sediment. caught in the tide as it recedes from shore; if you’re not careful, it will carry you out to sea. drifting endlessly in the interminable days after the solstice.</p>

        <p>It’s jarring to wake up one morning and realize the world has shifted on its axis. The collapsed, insular worldview of a college campus seemingly explodes overnight. The fairytale never gets its happy ending, the music stops, and the screen cuts to black.</p>

<p>Years from now, I wonder what I’ll say about what happened. If I’ll have more perspective and sympathy, if I’ll be even more bitter and vitriolic. That it was the kind of sweeping emotional turbulence that shakes up a generation and loses them to the current. That we never quite recovered because time heals all wounds except the ones it inflicted. That none of us woke up from the nightmare where the incongruities and uncertainties broke us.</p>

<p>Left us disoriented, wandering, directionless.</p>

        <p>There are stories that begin on airplanes. A one-way flight to nowhere, or a round-trip back home. A metal vessel in the skies, floating and drifting and soaring. Think of the 12 km column of air and space that separates the thin carpet beneath your feet and the expanse of the Atlantic eager to catch you if you fall. The glimpse of icebergs and glaciers above the poles, endless blankets of white with jagged sawtooth edges. The way you feel claustrophobic in your seat, pressed up against strangers and food carts. Space that’s not yours, only borrowed. Shallower breathing that made your heart work faster and harder. Maybe you unbuckle your seatbelt and stand to stretch, eager for a breath of clean oxygen that has not been recycled twice over. Think of who you meet on that late night, early morning (time knows no bounds here) excursion for an extra bag of pretzels, hands outstretched for more. The way you reached to close that space, high up in the atmosphere.</p>

        <p><em>why i’m worried about the future of tv.</em></p>

<p>normally, this week would be tv upfronts season—but since that’s no longer physically possible, i’m worried the tv industry won’t survive these times.</p>

<p>upfronts are the splashy events held by major tv networks three weeks into may to showcase their upcoming show programming and garner advertising interest. it’s one of the most exciting weeks of my year (it’s heaven for a tv nerd like me) because we get a sneak preview of all the new pilots and shows that we can anticipate in the fall. the bulk of ad spend for tv happens “up front,” so most of the tv advertising money moves during these upfronts events and dictates the health of the network for the coming year.</p>

<p>this year, we don’t have upfronts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is patriotism, but nostalgia for the foods of our youth?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently, I’ve been feeling very <strong>nostalgic</strong>. The extended time at home has stirred that yearning for the past, for younger years. It’s inspired by the craving for the foods I grew up on, the music that filled my afternoons, and the stories that shaped the way I see the world.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p><em>or: why riverdale could have been a much better show than it is</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of my favorite late night pasttimes is to watch YouTube compilations of <em>Riverdale</em> scenes. They are absolutely excoriating. I have spent so many hours thinking about how <em>Riverdale</em> could have been a better show. A much better show than whatever mess the writers are trying to pass off as melodrama with a cherry on top. To be frank, I haven’t seen an episode of Riverdale since the season 1 finale. I couldn’t get past the choppy pacing and chopped-up characters.</p>

<p>This show could have been incredible. It was sitting on a goldmine of potential, and its devoted teen audience has seen that storytelling potential waste away over the years. For however many more seasons the CW keeps renewing this show for, it won’t quite ever recover what the show could have been. Season 1, especially the pilot episode, felt ambient and precipitous. It felt like it was on the edge of something great and we were lucky enough to watch it unfold before us.</p>

        <p><strong>tigertail</strong> (dir. alan yang) was beautiful and poignant in the way you come home after a long day and allow yourself to slowly unwind in the silence. the film soaks in the quiet, recognizes that there aren’t always words to say what you mean, and visually renders those moments to speak louder than the script. it’s not a perfect film, but it is a poignant one. stop on any frame, and you see a sketch of yourself and your family in the mirror. these are a few things that made the film so resonant:</p>

<ol>
  <li>recognizing that the homeland is so bright and vibrant, yet so unbearable. our parents, grandparents all started somewhere—some version of that same concrete house and barely-paved dirt road.</li>
  <li>the monotony and loneliness of arriving somewhere new, unanchored. trying to put down roots in a place when you’re not sure it wants you.</li>
  <li>the sacrifices and choices we make so that someday we end up with a house on american soil. when does that stop being the dream? when did it stop for pin jui?</li>
</ol>

<p>it’s pin jui sitting with a cup of tea in his dining room, alone in a big house. it’s angela with a half-eaten meal, wishing her father would say something. it’s the two of them together, framed side-by-side by a concrete block at the end.</p>

<p>this film was alan yang’s way of producing a careful study of his own father, vivid in color and pensive in thought. it makes you want to stop and study your parents too; think about where they came from and what they have to say too.</p>

        <p><strong>moving portraits:</strong> a series about how the online and offline interact and collide</p>

<p><em>Living memory, as told through live performances.</em></p>

<p>Live performance is a dialogue. It is a magical, unspoken conversation that connects the performer with each member of that audience. It is the connection that stays with you in physical space, forged through the visual, auditory, and tactile sensory input that is only possible by experiencing the performance/demonstration in a real, live setting. The relevance of live performance is to build that connection between observer and art, but also to initiate the live dialogue that occurs after. There is something special at the conclusion of a performance when you have a chance to react, process what you have seen, and reflect with those around you about what you have just experienced. Those conversations often cement the value and significance of the performance; and that reflection transforms a live performance into an experience and a memory that is enriching, immersive, and above all, timeless.</p>

        <p><strong>bright lights / big city:</strong> <em>a love letter to cityscapes and the urban form</em></p>

<p><em>Invisible Cities</em> by Italo Calvino is a literary monument to cities. <em>Invisible Cities</em> was the last piece of literature I read in English class before graduating from high school. Calvino’s vivid love letter to cities in all their iterations captured the goodbye I said to my hometown city of New York as I left for a new city—Cambridge. My love for Calvino’s work is rooted in its sentimentality, but also originates in its effortless universality.</p>

<p>My favorite of the invisible cities is Chloe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Chloe, a great city, the people who move through the streets are all strangers. At each encounter, they imagine a thousand things about one another; meetings which could take place between them, conversations, surprises, caresses, bites. But no one greets anyone; eyes lock for a second, then dart away, seeking other eyes, never stopping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a quality that is unmistakably New York simmering underneath Calvino’s description: for that, it is truly beautiful. The greatest strength of <em>Invisible Cities</em> is its intersectionality. One city could just as easily be another city. Just as the cities are themselves, Calvino’s descriptions are eternal and fluid.</p>

        <p>though we may be grieving for the past few february weeks spent writing in the desolate winter, the 29th is a special leap day that comes with the promise of a new spring. for one day every four years, we stand in abeyance until we see the spring sun rise in the blue sky once again. we find our temporary respite in a dream of spring, a safe harbor among the turbulent seas of the winter nightmare.</p>

        <p>at it’s heart, <em>to all the boys i’ve loved before</em> is a love letter to what it means to be a teenage girl. in all of its painfully introspective, pastel-pink glory. it’s about personal identity; growing up and becoming less fearful of change; the people we let into our lives (and also the people who leave); and learning to live a perfectly imperfect life.</p>

        <p>Parental wisdom tells you to avoid strangers. Don’t talk to strangers. Don’t accept candy from strangers. Don’t get into a stranger’s car. <em>Well</em>, that last one doesn’t apply anymore.</p>

<p>The rise of consumer-facing products in the stranger-sphere have been well-documented and thoroughly discussed. The mechanics and implications of ride-sharing like Lyft and Uber and home-staying like Airbnb and relationship-building like Tinder and Bumble and even service-providing like Thumbtack or Handy. These are marketplaces driven by supply and demand for and because of strangers.</p>

<p>Everything we do offline has always been with strangers: the cashier at the grocery store, the driver in the cab, the receptionist at the check-in desk. The invitation here is different. We are inviting people—complete strangers—into our homes, and more profoundly, our lives. We let them take up space and time, even for a brief moment, and that’s important.</p>

        <p>frost still clings to the orchard. ice hangs from the branches; it weighs down the weathered wooden skeleton of trees that once stood tall. the leaves have long fallen, the birds departed. nothing left but the howling winds and crunch of ice beneath worn boots.</p>

<p>in the august sun, the apples were sweet and tart. they tasted like late summer miracles and found themselves baked into pies and boiled down to ciders.</p>

        <p>I have always loved the idea that everyone has a soundtrack to their own lives. They hear it in their earbuds walking down the street, in their carefully curated spotify librarities. It’s something so intensely personal and imprinted in their minds, and very few people are privvy to it. We all have a soundtrack. It plays in the background of all the moments in our life, mundane or extraordinary. A movie. It’s why some songs stick with us in time, lingering at the edges of memory. Still playing in the background while the scene runs. Next scene.</p>

  <p>“What about us taking an adventure east?” <br /> “Like Queens?” <br /> <br /> — Crazy Rich Asians, dir. John Chu</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought I knew what kind of film Crazy Rich Asians would be.
When Crazy Rich Asians hit theatres a year ago on August 15th, 2018, I anticipated it would make a modest splash at the box office and linger at a middling, splotchy green Rotten Tomatoes approval rating. The estimated $20 million opening weekend prediction would soon fizzle out. Headlines would praise its ambition, lush visuals, and breakout performances, but universally pan its trite romance and paper-thin villains. We would forget about the film as quickly as it came — and I really, truly hoped I was wrong. Even then, I would have watched it and loved it and celebrated it every step of the way.</p>

<p>One year later, I am so glad to say I was wrong.</p>

        <p>We’re coming up on the 1-year anniversary of the breakout Netflix film, <em>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before</em>. I have a lot of love for this movie, and even more for the original trilogy written by Jenny Han. On August 17, 2018, the internet met Lara Jean Song-Covey. A wide-eyed teenager who loved love, but was hesitant to open herself up to it. She writes letters to her lost loves, the boys who got away; then she locks up those feelings in a teal hat box and puts the emotional tumult to rest. Lara Jean thinks she’s in love with the boys of her past, these ghosts she’s sealed in A4 envelopes with hand-lettered addresses. She <em>is</em> in love though — in love with the idea of being in love with them. It’s a little different when you put it that way.</p>

<p>It is the way you can convince yourself that you’re in love with something, someone before you really know what it means. They’re like false positives on your way to emotional discovery. Let’s talk about love, maybe write it a letter or two, and what it means to have a past love.</p>
