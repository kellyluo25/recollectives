    <p><strong>bright lights / big city:</strong> <em>a love letter to cityscapes and the urban form</em></p>

<p><em>Invisible Cities</em> by Italo Calvino is a literary monument to cities. <em>Invisible Cities</em> was the last piece of literature I read in English class before graduating from high school. Calvino’s vivid love letter to cities in all their iterations captured the goodbye I said to my hometown city of New York as I left for a new city—Cambridge. My love for Calvino’s work is rooted in its sentimentality, but also originates in its effortless universality.</p>

<p>My favorite of the invisible cities is Chloe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Chloe, a great city, the people who move through the streets are all strangers. At each encounter, they imagine a thousand things about one another; meetings which could take place between them, conversations, surprises, caresses, bites. But no one greets anyone; eyes lock for a second, then dart away, seeking other eyes, never stopping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a quality that is unmistakably New York simmering underneath Calvino’s description: for that, it is truly beautiful. The greatest strength of <em>Invisible Cities</em> is its intersectionality. One city could just as easily be another city. Just as the cities are themselves, Calvino’s descriptions are eternal and fluid.</p>
