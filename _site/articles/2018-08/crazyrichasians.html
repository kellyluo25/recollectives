  <p>“What about us taking an adventure east?” <br /> “Like Queens?” <br /> <br /> — Crazy Rich Asians, dir. John Chu</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought I knew what kind of film Crazy Rich Asians would be.
When Crazy Rich Asians hit theatres a year ago on August 15th, 2018, I anticipated it wouldmake a modest splash at the box office and linger at a middling, splotchy green Rotten Tomatoes approval rating. The estimated $20 million opening weekend prediction would soon fizzle out. Headlines would praise its ambition, lush visuals, and breakout performances, but universally pan its trite romance and paper-thin villains. We would forget about the film as quickly as it came — and I really, truly hoped I was wrong. Even then, I would have watched it and loved it and celebrated it every step of the way.</p>

<p>One year later, I am so glad to say I was wrong.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>As far as Hollywood films go, Crazy Rich Asians arrived as the follow-up to Baz Luhrmann’s 2013 adaptation of The Great Gatsby: beautiful to look at and far too self-indulgent to sensibly watch. When Tobey McGuire’s voice narrates ahead of the opening chords of Jay Z and Kanye’s “No Church in the Wild” at the start of the Gatsby trailer, we know we’re in store for something dark and sinister. When Skylar Grey’s sharp vocals break over the chorus of “Glorious” at the end of the Crazy Rich Asians trailer, it feels like a triumphant rebirth gilded in Singaporean gold. It sounds like the fulfillment of a great promise that Hollywood has forsaken so many times before — this is your time, so take center stage.</p>

<p>I spent a week in June of last summer flying through the pages of Kevin Kwan’s Crazy Rich Asians trilogy. All three books, from Crazy Rich Asians to China Rich Girlfriend to Rich People Problems, with a love to hate it mentality. There’s an addictive quality to Kwan’s writing from the name-dropping of haute couture designers to the luscious descriptions of Pan-Asian cuisine. It is gluttony in its highest literary form. His prose is sterling silver: nice to look at from a distance, but quickly loses its shine the closer you inspect it. Every time Kwan describes a Parisian shopping extravaganza worth a few million Euros or some priceless historical artifact worn as trivial everyday jewelry, you can’t help but roll your eyes (a lot). This is no rags to riches story — all that new money is sneered upon those sitting on generations of stocks and lucrative trade routes. This is a competition of rich and richer, where the rich have nothing better to do but idly sit and play a tedious game of gossip roulette against the beautiful backdrop of Singapore.</p>

<p>There are brief glimmers of humility in the book when Kwan’s characters are broken down by the construct of their own wealth and that fleeting vulnerability humanizes them, if only for a moment, in a way their deep pockets never could. Money is faceless in this novel. It is spent on dresses and luncheons and mansions, but there are no dollar amounts or price tags attached to any of it. The people of this novel are wealthy because money is their birthright. To overindulge ourselves in this would be to remain ignorant of the facts: that this is still a story of rich East Asians and ignores the reality of Singapore’s ethnic makeup, that poverty rates among Southeast Asian Americans remain high, that for every glittering skyscraper shown in the Singaporean skyline there is another humanitarian crisis in Asia that remains invisible. There are so many facts and figures to unpack that a two-hour movie simply isn’t the place or time.</p>

<p>The area Kwan excels in most is his portrait of family. The loud, sprawling web that is a family that fights and loves and means well but does more harm than good sometimes. The way Asian parents have a hold on their children that is an inexplicable medley of fear and devotion. The way sons and daughters have big dreams and high hopes and wonder if they will ever make something of themselves in this brave new world. The way generations weigh heavily on one’s shoulders, so heavy it can be hard to keep your head up. Young or old and rich or poor, there is a certain universality to family. Family keeps you grounded and breaks your heart at the same time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Scientists talk about how we inherit health issues from our parents through our genes, but we also inherit this entire lineage of fear and pain — generations of it.” <br /> <br /> — Rich People Problems, Kevin Kwan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asian American identity is messy and complicated. Remember those generations of pain? They’re still here, and don’t you forget it. Crazy Rich Asians makes no claim to untangle that web for audiences, a narrative web that could fill volumes of more books and films and television shows. The series only tiptoes the borderline of Asian and Asian American and everything in between, although it does enough to make that messy and complicated story feel seen and heard in popular media for once. The immigrant story has been so central to the Asian American narrative, to all the sons and daughters of immigrants who made their way across the Pacific Ocean. Crazy Rich Asians tells its own version of that journey and Rachel Chu’s Cupertino roots are only a small piece of it. Crazy Rich Asians is no Chinese-American immigrant story that ABC’s Fresh Off the Boat has brought to the small screen.</p>

<p>Displacement from the homeland is a consequence of modern circumstance rather than a fight or flight ultimatum. The fish out of water narrative here is the American thrust into the heart of Singaporean royalty. The struggle is all personal, characterized by gossipy, backstabbing cousins and fancy designer dresses, and the setting is as modern as it gets this century. The intention is not to belittle the magnitude of the story, but rather comment on how different it is in tone. This is a romantic comedy starring a global, all-Asian cast with Asian American leads. Let that sink in for a moment.</p>

<p>Then ask, when was the last time that happened?</p>

<p>If we strip away the crazy and the rich, we have people. They fall in love and meet the parents and make stupid choices and pick themselves back up from rock bottom. This is a story you could have told a million times over with a different cast of different names and races, but this is a story we got to keep for ourselves and share with the rest of the world. There is something so heartbreakingly poignant about that.</p>

<p>It would be foolish to stake the future of Asian-American cinema on the success of Crazy Rich Asians because we know it is going to be a bad movie, but we’re not watching this because we think it will be the next great Oscar contender. We are watching this because we finally have a chance to see ourselves, our parents and siblings, aunts and uncles and cousins, grandparents and great-grandparents, best friends and neighbors, and some permutation thereof of all the people in our everyday lives in a glamorous cinematic experience. Everyone involved in the film has championed it from the very beginning and we are so grateful for its existence and eager for it to become successful. They have written, directed, and acted in a Hollywood conversation starter. Even still, we remain realistic in our expectations and know we are not waiting for this film to reveal some deeper truth. This is a first step, not a revolution.</p>

  <p>“It’s not just about suddenly that we have our Black Panther…however it will be authentically for us, it will come. But until that day, each of us individually, I feel like have to work on what that means to us and be practicing that every day.” <br /> <br /> — Sandra Oh, interview with CAPE (Coalition for Asian Pacifics in Entertainment)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all have a complicated relationship with ourselves, our families, and most of all, our history. Somewhere along the way, we forgot who that history belonged to and whose duty it was to tell it. Crazy Rich Asians isn’t groundbreaking in story, but it is breaking new ground. It is breaking that ground so the rest of us have a voice in the kind of stories we would like to tell. It may be a terrible romcom, or it may be a phenomenal work of cinematic art; yet in this one shining moment in time, we finally have a movie that is ours and it feels glorious.</p>

<p>Thank you for making this movie and fighting for it — thank you thank you thank you.</p>
