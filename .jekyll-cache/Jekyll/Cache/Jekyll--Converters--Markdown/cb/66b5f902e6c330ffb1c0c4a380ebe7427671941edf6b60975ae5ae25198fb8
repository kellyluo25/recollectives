<p>Itâ€™s March 18th. My writing gets further and further away from consistency. Itâ€™s been a hard few weeks.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>my life into folklore:</strong> the grammy awards, and this album that snapped me out of a quarantine stupor</li>
  <li><strong>post-apocalyptic musicscapes</strong>: music tells time better than our memories can</li>
  <li><strong>you canâ€™t say someone deserved better</strong>: nobody should deserve justice if we all entitled to it</li>
</ul>
