I"L<p>the last time i was truly surprised by something, it was when taylor swift released her eight album <em>folklore</em> in july of 2020, in the middle of a summer that never seemed to end. it revitalized me in this strange, alchemic way that reminded me of who i was in the past muddled with whatever i was in the present. at the end of this year, <em>folklore</em> said she had a sad older sister, and <em>evermore</em> became another surprise release. the second time i was truly surprised.</p>

<p>the trying times of this year has brought us not one, but two, surprise cabin-in-the-woods albums from taylor. and somehow, it was everything we needed to get through isolation in this cold winter. <em>folklore</em> was the fading light from a dissipating source of warmth; <em>evermore</em> is the frost from the chill that never left.</p>
