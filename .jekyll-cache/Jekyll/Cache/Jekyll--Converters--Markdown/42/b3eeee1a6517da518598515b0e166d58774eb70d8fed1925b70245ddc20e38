I"|<p>I have always loved the idea that everyone has a soundtrack to their own lives.</p>

<p>They hear it in their earbuds walking down the street, in their carefully curated spotify libraries. It’s something so intensely personal and imprinted in their minds, and very few people are privy to it. We all have a soundtrack. It plays in the background of all the moments in our life, mundane or extraordinary. A movie. It’s why some songs stick with us in time, lingering at the edges of memory. Still playing in the background while the scene runs. Next scene.</p>
