I"y<p>in 2006 office depot created one of the most influential consumer products ever — elf yourself.</p>

<p>maybe i am still wrapped up in the holiday craze, but i recently used it again and while watching my head on a dancing elf, i couldn’t stop thinking about how this website is <em>still</em> unfailingly funny + shareable + delightful, and has sustained success year over year.</p>

<p>elf yourself turned a niche use case into a viral marketing campaign that resonated with a core group of older users (did someone accidentally say product/market fit). the act of inserting personal images in a funny video designated for sharing became a social tradition that echoes the standards of content creation on any device with a front-facing camera these days.</p>

<p>its face-capture and motion-tracking capabilities were surprisingly ahead of its time in a mass consumer product. it nurtured this early idea of transforming a manipulated image of your face into an instantly shareable meme in your social network.</p>

<p>this somehow feels like the predecessor to snapchat’s success with face filters—face morphing, funny effects, sharing mechanisms—which then rippled across photo-first “story” creation &amp; creative selfie-editing tools.</p>

<p>this could also be a wildly festive misappropriation of internet history, but elf yourself is a living fossil of the web 2.0 days. despite its heavy seasonal usage, the fact that it has stood the test of time says a lot about it as a product.</p>

<p>that and the nearly 2 billion elves that have been created since its inception.</p>
