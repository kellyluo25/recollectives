I"1<p>We’re coming up on the 1-year anniversary of the breakout Netflix film, <em>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before</em>. I have a lot of love for this movie, and even more for the original trilogy written by Jenny Han. On August 17, 2018, the internet met Lara Jean Song-Covey. A wide-eyed teenager who loved love, but was hesitant to open herself up to it. She writes letters to her lost loves, the boys who got away; then she locks up those feelings in a teal hat box and puts the emotional tumult to rest. Lara Jean thinks she’s in love with the boys of her past, these ghosts she’s sealed in A4 envelopes with hand-lettered addresses. She is in love though — in love with the idea of being in love with them. It’s a little different when you put it that way.</p>

<p>It is the way you can convince yourself that you’re in love with something, someone before you really know what it means. They’re like false positives on your way to emotional discovery. Let’s talk about love, maybe write it a letter or two, and what it means to have a past love.</p>
