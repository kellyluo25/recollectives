<p>In a past-life, I would write a series about the seasons. Iâ€™d use those installments to mark the passage of time and wax poetic about the seasons evolving and bleeding into each other. That as one season ended and another began, weâ€™d keep moving forward: because the seasons would keep changing even as we asked (kindly) for it to stop. Each new season beautifully distinct from the last, but resolute in their transient familiarity.</p>

<p>As the twentieth year of the millennia turned into the twenty-first, the days turned into months and the months have become a year and some change. Just like the rest of us, the seasons are scathing, bitter, and weary.</p>

<p>I read something about the seasons this past year that Iâ€™ll think about forever: â€œ<em>the seasons no longer mark the passing of time but various failed bargains with nature.</em>â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve failed so many times.</p>
