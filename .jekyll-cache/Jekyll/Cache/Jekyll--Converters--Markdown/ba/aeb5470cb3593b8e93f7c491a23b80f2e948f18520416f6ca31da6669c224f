I"<p>This is an essay about music and memory—not because I have any specific opinions about music—but because I am acutely aware of the time-travelling nature of sonic textures.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>the time we woke up to find that summer had gone</strong>: getting closer to the songs of summer</li>
  <li><strong>with some indie record that’s much cooler</strong>: we are who we listen to</li>
  <li><strong>something as good as our song</strong>: music supervision, and the soundtrack of our lives</li>
</ul>
