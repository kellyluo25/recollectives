<p>Itâ€™s February 15th. We are one-and-a-half months into the new year.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>all stories have a beginning, middle, and end</strong>: to all the boys: always and forever ends as a love letter to endings and how hard it is to say goodbye.</li>
  <li><strong>we were both young</strong>: love story (taylorâ€™s version) collapsed the years between middle school and adulthood.</li>
  <li><strong>something like chasing stars</strong>: the american narrative is obsessed with space movies and sending astronauts on interstellar adventures</li>
</ul>
