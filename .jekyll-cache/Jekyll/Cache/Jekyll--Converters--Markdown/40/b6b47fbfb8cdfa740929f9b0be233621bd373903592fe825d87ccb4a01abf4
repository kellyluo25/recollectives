<p>It appears that a weekly newsletter has now turned seasonal. An unfortunate, but not irreversible problem. Every so often, Iâ€™ll have a stray, aberrant thought that Iâ€™ll jot into my drafts and never release into the world. At some point, it may be useful to stop thinking about those as aberrations and give them the space to exist as fully-formed ideas. As they say, publishing something is better than nothing; no use in waiting for me to publish the next one.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>iâ€™ll write you a postcard, send you the news</strong>: august slipped away into a moment in time</li>
  <li><strong>the forgotten half of the holland tunnel</strong>: jack antonoff &amp; co makes music for pop princesses and the underdogs of the jersey suburbs</li>
  <li><strong>your emotional baggage can be picked up at the next carousel:</strong> emotional baggage, flight risk, and other air travel metaphors for thought</li>
</ul>
