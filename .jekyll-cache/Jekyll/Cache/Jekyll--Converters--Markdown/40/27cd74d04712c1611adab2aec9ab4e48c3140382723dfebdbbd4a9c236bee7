<p>We’re in the double digits now and that’s a modern miracle. I was going to spend this collection writing about something else, but then I read “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/i-cant-stop-thinking-about-this">i can’t stop thinking about this</a>” and, well, these are some things i can’t stop thinking about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>in the pantomime</strong>: the winter olympics are nothing without canadian ice dancing royalty</li>
  <li><strong>cosmic operas:</strong> florence + the machine lyrics are something else</li>
  <li><strong>tossed and turned</strong>: i promised some people i would write about hacky sack</li>
</ul>
