I"Ó<p>Parental wisdom tells you to avoid strangers. Donâ€™t talk to strangers. Donâ€™t accept candy from strangers. Donâ€™t get into a strangerâ€™s car. <em>Well</em>, that last one doesnâ€™t apply anymore.</p>

<p>The rise of consumer-facing products in the stranger-sphere have been well-documented and thoroughly discussed. The mechanics and implications of ride-sharing like Lyft and Uber and home-staying like Airbnb and relationship-building like Tinder and Bumble and even service-providing like Thumbtack or Handy. These are marketplaces driven by supply and demand for and because of strangers.</p>

<p>Everything we do offline has always been with strangers: the cashier at the grocery store, the driver in the cab, the receptionist at the check-in desk. The invitation here is different. We are inviting peopleâ€”complete strangersâ€”into our homes, and more profoundly, our lives. We let them take up space and time, even for a brief moment, and thatâ€™s important.</p>
