<blockquote>
  <p>the scene, ten years ago:</p>

  <p>a train pulls into grand central; a soft camera shutter; the backseat of a black limousine; central park at the dawn of winter; tight headbands and loose scarves; and hereâ€™s a secret: happiness does not seem to be on the menu.</p>

<p>If you know anything about me, you know that I hold a deep reverence for <em>gossip girl</em>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m serious: the collective of post-<em>gossip girl</em> society thinks and behaves in a completely different way because of this show that premiered on the CW in September of 2007. (September 19th, 2007 at 9/8c to be exact.)</p>

<p>I sat down to write my magnum opus on why <em>gossip girl</em> was the greatest show, period. This isnâ€™t that post.*</p>

<p>They donâ€™t make shows like this anymore. By all counts, <em>gossip girl</em> was a terrible showâ€”mired in melodrama and miseryâ€“but I stand by the first season of the show as the pinnacle of modern television. I cannot, in good conscience, defend any season after the first.</p>

<p><em>gossip girl</em> was lightning in a MoÃ«t bottle: a pre-during-post meditation on the recession generation; the rich (always) getting richer; our young, budding relationship to the internet and to each other in the anonymity of cyberspace; media creation and consumption at the precipice of pixel-driven virality; a parody of celebrity before it became unchecked influence; smudged fingerprints of gilded-age wealth as the axis of capital itself has shifted; beautiful, photogenic people basically getting away with murder; the city of new york at a reckoning with itself; the kind of super rich kid problems that feel down to earth and detached in outer space; elitism and classism and all the -isms that are trivial to the people at the top; and the rest of us at the bottom, longingly watching from our voyeuristic vantage point of aspiration.</p>

<p>The music in <em>gossip girl</em> was a visceral stylistic choice (listen: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5LS331Ne16mF0LoD1VGw9H?si=085bae754212401b">this spotify playlist</a>). This show was glamorous, glitzy, and golden: covered in lush excess, but beating with a real heart underneath. In the post-indie rock of the early 2000s to emergent edm-influenced pop of the late 2000s, emerged Josh Schwartz-produced television as a vehicle for musical discovery.</p>

<p>That was the most striking thing about <em>gossip girlâ€™s</em> sensibility: it was musical in the way it was poppy and resplendent, yet also sullen and subtle. The original pilot was a paragon of this duality. Top 40 Radio meets undiscovered iTunes gem.</p>

<p>The pilot featured the hits of the 2007 heyday, with Timbalandâ€™s â€œThe Way I Areâ€ introducing the Kiss on the Lips party, a whirlwind spin with Justin Timberlakeâ€™s â€œWhat Goes Aroundâ€ after Serenaâ€™s sudden rearrival sends shockwaves through the social scene. At the same time, the series begins with the folksy twang of Peter, Bjorn and Johnâ€™s â€œYoung Folksâ€ hummed above a loud train pulling into Grand Central, later Albert Hammond Jrâ€™s â€œItâ€™s Hard to Live in the Cityâ€ plays above these teens packed into  a party-bound limoâ€”cements the sonic textures of the Upper East Side that would soon become iconic.</p>

<p>The 2021 pilot doesnâ€™t quite live up to the musical legacy of its predecessor, but it gets off the right foot and has enough time to grow. Frank Oceanâ€™s â€œSuper Rich Kidsâ€ is precisely an inspired choice to anchor the first series trailer, and also the first glimpse of the core seven in the same scene of the Constance courtyard. The injection of â€œpositionsâ€ by Ariana Grande marks the grand, fashionably late return to the Gossip Girl 2.0 voiceover under the tones of Kristen Bellâ€™s long-missed signature snark. Thereâ€™s a new guard in town.</p>

<p>*Iâ€™m not quite there yet, but perhaps Iâ€™ll gather these thoughts on paper when Iâ€™m feeling particularly sharp pangs of nostalgia during the season finale of the reboot.</p>
