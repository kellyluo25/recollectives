I"<p><strong>tigertail</strong> (dir. alan yang) was beautiful and poignant in the way you come home after a long day and allow yourself to slowly unwind in the silence. the film soaks in the quiet, recognizes that there arenâ€™t always words to say what you mean, and visually renders those moments to speak louder than the script. itâ€™s not a perfect film, but it is a poignant one. stop on any frame, and you see a sketch of yourself and your family in the mirror. these are a few things that made the film so resonant:</p>

<ol>
  <li>recognizing that the homeland is so bright and vibrant, yet so unbearable. our parents, grandparents all started somewhereâ€”some version of that same concrete house and barely-paved dirt road.</li>
  <li>the monotony and loneliness of arriving somewhere new, unanchored. trying to put down roots in a place when youâ€™re not sure it wants you.</li>
  <li>the sacrifices and choices we make so that someday we end up with a house on american soil. when does that stop being the dream? when did it stop for pin jui?</li>
</ol>

<p>itâ€™s pin jui sitting with a cup of tea in his dining room, alone in a big house. itâ€™s angela with a half-eaten meal, wishing her father would say something. itâ€™s the two of them together, framed side-by-side by a concrete block at the end.</p>

<p>this film was alan yangâ€™s way of producing a careful study of his own father, vivid in color and pensive in thought. it makes you want to stop and study your parents too; think about where they came from and what they have to say too.</p>
