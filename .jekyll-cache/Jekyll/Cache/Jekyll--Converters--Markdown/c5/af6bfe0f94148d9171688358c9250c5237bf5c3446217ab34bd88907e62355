I"2<p>a generation raised by the internet. growing up in a digital headspace with bodies in a physical world. coming of age with the internet as the internet came of age itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it reminds you of another time in your life when online was the only thing that mattered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>essays that i will someday write on:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>lowercase legacies</em>: all-lowercase writing as a a structural condition for interpreting the internet environment</li>
  <li><em>the making of an aesthetic</em>: the ~ aesthetic ~ as digital ambiance, how they’re formed and take shape, and whether they last.</li>
  <li><em>the online blues: #36465D in a #001935 world</em>: tumblr as a genre-defining cornerstone of the internet, and that strange indie internet conciousness that has somehow elevated to the mainstream.</li>
</ul>

<p>aesthetics as digital ambiance. maybe it’s how the dusty pastels meet pantone swatches, or the thick serif type meets the occasional slab accent. or maybe it’s the blindings neons and bold geometry, minimized by pixels and sharpened by distortion. what are the forms and factors that turn a visual into a style that is recognizable and pervasive on the internet?</p>

<p>how that weird teen consciousness that emerged on tumblr in the early 2010s has transformed what we know of modern culture today through its uncanny prescience, useful anonymity, and unparalleled in-jokes.</p>
