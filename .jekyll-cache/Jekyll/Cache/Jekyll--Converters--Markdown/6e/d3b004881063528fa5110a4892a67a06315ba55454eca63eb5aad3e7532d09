I"á<p>we all have these. thoughts that wonâ€™t leave our brain. things we spend a lot of time thinking about.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>the bildungsroman</strong>: our coming of age has come and gone</li>
  <li><strong>cultural artifacts</strong>: the stories we keep coming back to</li>
  <li><strong>national geography</strong>: places and what they mean to a people</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>these are the things iâ€™ve spent my whole life trying to put into words</em></p>
