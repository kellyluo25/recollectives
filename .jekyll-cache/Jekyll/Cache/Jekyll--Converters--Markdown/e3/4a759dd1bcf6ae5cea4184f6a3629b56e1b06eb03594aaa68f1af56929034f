I"@<p>a generation raised by the internet. growing up in a digital headspace with bodies in a physical world. coming of age with the internet as the internet came of age itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it reminds you of another time in your life when online was the only thing that mattered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>essays that i will someday (start and) finish writing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>lowercase legacies</strong>: all-lowercase writing as a structural condition for internet cognition and communication.</li>
  <li><strong>signed by screenname</strong>: the selection of a screenname as a signature of ourselves, the multiplicity of our many names, and forks of our digital identity scattered to the winds</li>
  <li><strong>the making of an aesthetic</strong>: the ~ aesthetic ~ as digital ambiance, how theyâ€™re formed and take shape, and whether they last.</li>
  <li><strong>the online blues: #36465D vs #001935</strong>: tumblr as a genre-defining cornerstone of the internet, and that strange indie internet conciousness that has somehow elevated to the mainstream.</li>
</ul>
