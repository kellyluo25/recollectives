<p>I had called it an interminable summer. The days were senseless and the months were beyond my senses. I couldn’t feel the time passing, only a current of afternoons and nights that eclipsed one after the other.</p>

<p>Among critic circles, <em>folklore</em> was lionized as the “quintessential quarantine album”. It was a concept borne and executed only under circumstances as cosmic and devastating as the past year.</p>

<p>It was the kind of thing none of us expected, but once it was part of our lives, it made itself permanent. <em>Folklore</em> won a <em>Grammy</em> for that, Taylor’s third <em>Grammy Award</em> in fact.</p>

<p>My sonic memories of 2017, in soft vocals and sparse instruments. It sounds, overwhelmingly, like <em>Novo Amor</em>. How the timbre of his music transports me to long bus rides in the January cold. Back in 2017 when everything was just beginning and would be over as soon as I knew it.</p>

<p>The news has been treacherous this week (and the week before). The headlines have been marred by violence and suffering and outrage. It’s all so inevitable, yet inevitably pitiful. The news cycle won’t stop, but time is supposed to go on.</p>
