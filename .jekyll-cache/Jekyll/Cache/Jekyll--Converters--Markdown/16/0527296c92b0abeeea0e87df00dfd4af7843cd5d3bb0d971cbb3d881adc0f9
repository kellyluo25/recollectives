<p>I thought I knew what kind of film Crazy Rich Asians would be.
When Crazy Rich Asians hit theatres a year ago on August 15th, 2018, I anticipated it wouldmake a modest splash at the box office and linger at a middling, splotchy green Rotten Tomatoes approval rating. The estimated $20 million opening weekend prediction would soon fizzle out. Headlines would praise its ambition, lush visuals, and breakout performances, but universally pan its trite romance and paper-thin villains. We would forget about the film as quickly as it came — and I really, truly hoped I was wrong. Even then, I would have watched it and loved it and celebrated it every step of the way.</p>

<p>One year later, I am so glad to say I was wrong.</p>
