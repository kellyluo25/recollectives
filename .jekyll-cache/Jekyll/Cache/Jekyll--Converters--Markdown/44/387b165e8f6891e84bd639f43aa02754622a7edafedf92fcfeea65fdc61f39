<p>Itâ€™s February 23rd. Iâ€™m trying my best to write with some semblance of consistency, and forcing myself to write, even if I secretly donâ€™t want to, for at least an hour a week. Consistent quantity creates quality, said a self-help book (probably).</p>

  <li><strong>martin scorsese hates content</strong>: one of the godfathers of modern cinema has strong words about what the algorithm did to content</li>
  <li><strong>wandavision made (linear) television cool again:</strong> if netflix invented the binge, then disney+ reinvented water cooler talk</li>
</ul>
