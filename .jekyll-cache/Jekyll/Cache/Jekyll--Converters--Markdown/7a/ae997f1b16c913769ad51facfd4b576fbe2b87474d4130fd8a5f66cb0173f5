I"E<p>Itâ€™s been a while. Below are my missed synaptic connections, thoughts Iâ€™ve turned over and over in newly-formed neurons but couldnâ€™t quite electrify into fully-functioning thoughts.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>iâ€™ll make a myth out of you</strong>: make me into something better; or pretend iâ€™m someone better</li>
  <li><strong>a table set for you and who</strong>: an invitation into harryâ€™s house</li>
  <li><strong>hereâ€™s the succession plot</strong>: can we stop renewing this for another season</li>
</ul>
