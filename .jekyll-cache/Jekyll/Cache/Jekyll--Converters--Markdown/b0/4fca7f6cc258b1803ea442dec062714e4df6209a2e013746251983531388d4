I"ˆ<p>in 2006 office depot created one of the most influential consumer products ever â€” elf yourself.</p>

<p>maybe i am still wrapped up in the holiday craze, but i recently used it again and while watching my head on a dancing elf, i couldnâ€™t stop thinking about how this website is <em>still</em> unfailingly funny + shareable + delightful, and has sustained success year over year.</p>
