I"ç<p>we all have these‚Äîthe thoughts that won‚Äôt leave our brain. the things we spend a lot of time thinking about. half-baked musings that can keep us up at night or fill the blank pages of journals and blogposts. the conversations we have without ourselves about what matters to us and what we believe of the world.</p>

<p>and i‚Äôm still looking for the words to say the things i mean. someday, i might find them. for now, they exist as incomplete blurbs that magnify the connective synapses that map and connect these thoughts together:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>lifestyle genre</strong>: somehow we are constantly coming of age story</li>
  <li><strong>cultural artifacts</strong>: the stories we keep coming back to</li>
  <li><strong>national geography</strong>: places and what they mean to a people</li>
</ul>

<p><em>these are the things i‚Äôve spent my whole life trying to put into words</em></p>
