I"É<p>Another season is upon us. Taylor Swift announced a new album. I had trouble sleeping for a few weeks in August because I was overcaffeinated from green tea. I agonized over, then purchased an expensive pillow in a quest for better neck support.</p>

<p>At parties, Iâ€™d ask <em>what keeps you up at night?</em> into the din of the room, an attempted shortcut into the inner psyche.</p>

<p>Here are things that keep me up at night.</p>

<p>Another fall, another Taylor Swift album to spin cycles over.</p>

<h2 id="the-day-job">the day job</h2>

<p>I was asked recently</p>

<h2 id="staring-out-at-themidnightsea">staring out at theÂ <strong>midnight</strong>Â sea</h2>

<p>The nights are best for rabbit holes. For fixations. For hyperfixations. For things you canâ€™t stop thinking about even though youâ€™re pretty sure everyone else has moved on. That nobody cares about anymore, but still seizes you in the quiet late hours.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This mashup of <em>Perfect</em> and <em>Style</em> that perpetuates the mythic Harry Styles/Taylor Swift romance of 2013. This short-lived fling endures in the generational memory because these two songs, ostensibly written about one another, are so intoxicating when overlaid. Itâ€™s a tease of what was, and a window into what could have been.</li>
  <li>The marriage between Leighton Meester and Adam Brody as two very normal people who started a family, but who also happened to star in the two greatest cultural institutions known to the modern millennia. Itâ€™s the uncanny crossover of <em>Gossip Girl</em> and <em>The OC</em> that primetime melodrama could not script any better.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="does-it-ever-drive-you-crazy--just-how-fast-the-night-changes">does it ever drive you crazy ; just how fast the night changes?</h2>

<p>In the fall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a lavender-scented candle</li>
  <li>seal an envelope with hot wax</li>
  <li>mould a decorative object</li>
  <li>design a typographic poster</li>
  <li>acquire more postcards</li>
  <li>hike up a steeper hill</li>
</ul>

<p>The weather will soon turn warmer, and I will rekindle the warmth of possibility.</p>
