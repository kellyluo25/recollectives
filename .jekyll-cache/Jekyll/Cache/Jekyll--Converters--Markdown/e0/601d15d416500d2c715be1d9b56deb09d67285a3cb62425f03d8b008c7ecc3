I"A<p>I once read that <a href="https://inkmagician.tumblr.com/post/155262261071/january-yawns-into-existence-tender-mouthed-raw">months yawn into existence</a>â€”like a sharp inhale of untamed time that burns out of you as the days amble into weeks. Thatâ€™s what it feels like to make it to June: the contagion of one yawn after the other, when half the year gets lost behind and the remaining half unfurls.</p>

<p>This collection is about girlhood, womanhood; a future that is female as much as it is fleeting and fickle. A reminder that it is only June, and the worst is not over.</p>

  <li><strong>i know how this ends</strong>: today, the headline said the end is here</li>
  <li><strong>hello girl</strong>: clean girl, material girl, <em>that</em> girl</li>
</ul>
