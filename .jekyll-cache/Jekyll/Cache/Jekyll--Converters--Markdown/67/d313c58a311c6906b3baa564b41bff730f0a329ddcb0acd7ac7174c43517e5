<p>I am well over a month late with these words. Iâ€™ve been writing quite a bit for work, and those words have drained out of me onto Google Docs, but not quite on this little blog of mine. Perhaps the larger lesson here is that my words donâ€™t have to be perfect; I just need to find the will in me to write them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>color me imperfect</strong>: the renaissance of quarantined hobbies includes learning how to paint with messy, layered watercolors</li>
  <li><strong>the problem with pandemic storytelling</strong>: letâ€™s agree to stop romanticizing the times we are collectively trying to forget</li>
  <li><strong>meaning well with hypocrisy</strong>: i canâ€™t tell you how bad i am at something that i canâ€™t take my own advice</li>
</ul>
