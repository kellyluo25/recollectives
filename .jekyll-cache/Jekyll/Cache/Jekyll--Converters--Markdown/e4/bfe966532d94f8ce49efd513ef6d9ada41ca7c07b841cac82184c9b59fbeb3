  <p><em>or: why riverdale could have been a much better show than it is</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of my favorite late night pasttimes is to watch YouTube compilations of <em>Riverdale</em> scenes. They are absolutely excoriating. I have spent so many hours thinking about how <em>Riverdale</em> could have been a better show. A much better show than whatever mess the writers are trying to pass off as melodrama with a cherry on top. To be frank, I haven’t seen an episode of Riverdale since the season 1 finale. I couldn’t get past the choppy pacing and chopped-up characters.</p>

<p>This show could have been incredible. It was sitting on a goldmine of potential, and its devoted teen audience has seen that storytelling potential waste away over the years. For however many more seasons the CW keeps renewing this show for, it won’t quite ever recover what the show could have been. Season 1, especially the pilot episode, felt ambient and precipitous. It felt like it was on the edge of something great and we were lucky enough to watch it unfold before us.</p>
