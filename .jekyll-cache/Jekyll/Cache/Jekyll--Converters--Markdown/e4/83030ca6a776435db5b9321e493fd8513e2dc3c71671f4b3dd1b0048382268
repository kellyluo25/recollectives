I"¥<p>we all have theseâ€”the thoughts that wonâ€™t leave our brain. the things we spend a lot of time thinking about. half-baked musings that can keep us up at night or fill the blank pages of journals and blogposts. the conversations we have without ourselves about what matters to us and what we believe of the world.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>the bildungsroman</strong>: our coming of age has come and gone</li>
  <li><strong>cultural artifacts</strong>: the stories we keep coming back to</li>
  <li><strong>national geography</strong>: places and what they mean to a people</li>
</ul>

<p><em>these are the things iâ€™ve spent my whole life trying to put into words</em></p>
