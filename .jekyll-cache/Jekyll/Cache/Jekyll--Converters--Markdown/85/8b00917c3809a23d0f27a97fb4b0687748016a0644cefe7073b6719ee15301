I"O<p>i love winter. i love the way the frost clings to surfaces with an unyielding attachment, the way the cold works its way into your bones and wonâ€™t let out. winter is bitter and unrelenting, and it has a sinister and unsuspecting way of creeping up on you. a biting chill that rattled your insides and stayed past its welcome.</p>
