I"¾<p>we all have theseâ€”the thoughts that wonâ€™t leave our brain. the things we spend a lot of time thinking about. half-baked musings that can keep us up at night or fill the blank pages of journals and blogposts. the conversations we have without ourselves about what matters to us and what we believe of the world.</p>

<p>and iâ€™m still looking for the words to say the things i mean. someday, i might find them. for now, they exist as incomplete blurbs that magnify the connective synapses that map and connect these thoughts together:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>lifestyle genres</strong>: an ode to our constant coming of age</li>
  <li><strong>cultural artifacts</strong>: the stories we keep coming back to</li>
  <li><strong>national geography</strong>: places and what they mean to a people</li>
</ul>

<p><em>these are the things iâ€™ve spent my whole life trying to put into words</em></p>

<p>aesthetics as digital ambiance. maybe itâ€™s how the dusty pastels meet pantone swatches, or the thick serif type meets the occasional slab accent. or maybe itâ€™s the blindings neons and bold geometry, minimized by pixels and sharpened by distortion. what are the forms and factors that turn a visual into a style that is recognizable and pervasive on the internet?</p>

<p>how that weird teen consciousness that emerged on tumblr in the early 2010s has transformed what we know of modern culture today through its uncanny prescience, useful anonymity, and unparalleled in-jokes.</p>
