I"<p>we all have these—the thoughts that won’t leave our brain. the things we spend a lot of time thinking about. half-baked musings that can keep us up at night or fill the blank pages of journals and blogposts. the conversations we have without ourselves about what matters to us and what we believe of the world.</p>

<p>and i’m still looking for the words to say the things i mean. someday, i might find them. for now, they exist as incomplete blurbs that magnify the connective synapses that map and connect these thoughts together:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>lifestyle genres</strong>: an ode to our constant coming of age</li>
  <li><strong>cultural artifacts</strong>: the stories we keep coming back to</li>
  <li><strong>national geography</strong>: places and what they mean to a people</li>
</ul>

<p><em>these are the things i’ve spent my whole life trying to put into words</em></p>

<p>how that weird teen consciousness that emerged on tumblr in the early 2010s has transformed what we know of modern culture today through its uncanny prescience, useful anonymity, and unparalleled in-jokes</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>a love letter to limerence</strong>: why 99% of the romcoms i’ve seen are about infatuation and why that’s still so addicting. it’s the same old stories about meet cutes and first crush and homecoming dances and first dates and why is it always about the first?</li>
  <li><strong>sixteen going on seventeen</strong>: all i’ve literally ever wanted was for a movie to show teens who went to school, did their requisite extracurriculars, came home, and did homework. all i want is to see them do homework. we’re really not that exciting</li>
