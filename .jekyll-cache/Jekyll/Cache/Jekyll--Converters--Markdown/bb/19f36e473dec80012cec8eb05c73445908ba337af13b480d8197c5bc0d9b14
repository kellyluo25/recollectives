I"Ä<p>we all have theseâ€”the thoughts that wonâ€™t leave our brain. the things we spend a lot of time thinking about. half-baked musings that can keep us up at night or fill the blank pages of journals and blogposts. the conversations we have without ourselves about what matters to us and what we believe of the world.</p>

<p>and iâ€™m still looking for the words to say the things i mean. someday, i might find them. for now, they exist as incomplete blurbs that magnify the connective synapses that map and connect these thoughts together:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>lifestyle genre</strong>: somehow we are constantly coming of age</li>
  <li><strong>cultural artifacts</strong>: the stories we keep coming back to</li>
  <li><strong>national geography</strong>: places and what they mean to a people</li>
</ul>

<p><em>these are the things iâ€™ve spent my whole life trying to put into words</em></p>

<p>who is new york, why do we have a torturous love affair with this city, and the people who live here: the rich elite who sparkle in their park ave penthouses and the working class bootstrappers who cling to the hope of gold still in the concrete streets</p>

<p>american nostalgia filtered through the lens of retro suburban glamour, and how the sun, road, and bored allure of the 101 captures our wildest imagination of manifest destiny; the west as the place we manifest ourselves</p>
