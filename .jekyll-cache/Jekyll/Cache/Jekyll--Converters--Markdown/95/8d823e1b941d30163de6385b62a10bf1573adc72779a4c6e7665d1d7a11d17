<p>New year, new letter.</p>

<p>When you reset for a new year, you have to scrape-off and discard the decayed remainders of the last year. When youâ€™re stripped clean, youâ€™re reminded that there are a few things you still enjoy doing below the caked-on layers of being too busy to do something. Iâ€™ve found the temporary vigor to write about nothingness again, and for that I am thankful.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>listen up and let me tell you a story:</strong> six wives reclaim the musical narrative</li>
  <li><strong>the library card</strong>: plastic keys to an infinite universe</li>
  <li><strong>sunbursts and marble halls</strong>: your reality is effervescent</li>
</ul>
