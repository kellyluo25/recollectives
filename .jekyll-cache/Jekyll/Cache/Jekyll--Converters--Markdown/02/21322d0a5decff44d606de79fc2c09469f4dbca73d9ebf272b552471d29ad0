I"D<p>Sleepless nights when I try to make sense of the confused chaos of my own brain. These are the late hours when I think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>why we canâ€™t let teen girls like things and the <em>purchasing power</em> they command once their wallets are valuable</li>
  <li>skewed perception of fiscal value and monetary services, until one day we learn about <em>wall street</em> and everything changes</li>
  <li>the implicit generational trauma of being a <em>child of the internet</em>, information overload and polarization unbound.</li>
  <li>the fuzzy edges of my consciousness from self-aware to world-aware in a house of cards newscycle: that post 9-11, kindergarten during katrina, elementary school financial crisis <em>state of mind</em>.</li>
</ul>
