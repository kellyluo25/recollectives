<p>Iâ€™ve decided to reorient my habits. All it takes is one day to compound to the next, or whatever the useless conventional wisdom says about this. With renewed purpose and a small dash of optimism, Iâ€™m back to talking out loud here. To get back in the groove of things, these are some catch-up musings from March.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>fighting fire with fire</strong>: the little fires everywhere in our pandemic year</li>
  <li><strong>faring well with spiritfarer:</strong> get in spirits, weâ€™re playing a cozy management game about dying</li>
</ul>
