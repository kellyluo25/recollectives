<blockquote>
  <p>the scene, ten years ago:</p>

  <p>a train pulls into grand central; a soft camera shutter; the backseat of a black limousine; central park at the dawn of winter; tight headbands and loose scarves; and hereâ€™s a secret: happiness does not seem to be on the menu.</p>

<p>If you know anything about me, you know that I hold a deep reverence for <em>gossip girl</em>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m serious: the collective of post-<em>gossip girl</em> society thinks and behaves in a completely different way because of this show that premiered on the CW in September of 2007. (September 19th, 2007 at 9/8c to be exact.)</p>

<p>I sat down to write my magnum opus on why <em>gossip girl</em> was the greatest show, period. This isnâ€™t that post.*</p>
